# Inability to fulfill max registered addresses

### Summary

In the `EthosProfile` contract you may register addresses and later delete them. The contract also gives the ability to restore deleted addresses. The problem is that when you restore an address, it is not removed from the profile's `removedAddresses` and the `isAddressCompromised` flag is not set to false.
The missing removal from `removedAddresses` will decrease the max addresses a user can register because [`EthosProfile::checkMaxAddresses`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L732) sums both removed and present addresses:

```javascript
function checkMaxAddresses(uint256 profileId) internal view {
    uint256 sum = profiles[profileId].addresses.length;
    sum += profiles[profileId].removedAddresses.length;
```

### Root Cause

In [`EthosProfile:373`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L373) there is a missing check if an address was previously registerred and it is not removed from the `removedAddresses` array

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The protocol has set the max addresses to 3 for example
2. Alice registers a second address
3. Alice deletes the second address
4. Later, Alice restores it
5. Alices tries to register a third address but she is not able to do so


### Impact

Users may not use the full capacity of the `maxNumberOfAddresses`

### PoC

Place the following describe block in `EthosProfile.test.ts`:

```javascript
describe('POC', () => {
  it('should verify user cannot register third address', async () => {
    const {
      ethosProfile,
      PROFILE_CREATOR_0,
      EXPECTED_SIGNER,
      OTHER_0,
      OTHER_1,
      OWNER,
      ADMIN,
    } = await loadFixture(deployFixture);

    const profileId = String(2);

    const issueSignature = async (address: string, random: string) => {
      return await common.signatureForRegisterAddress(
        address,
        profileId,
        random,
        EXPECTED_SIGNER
      );
    };

    await ethosProfile.connect(OWNER).inviteAddress(PROFILE_CREATOR_0.address);
    await ethosProfile.connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0).createProfile(1);

    /* Register second addresses */
    let rand = '123';
    let signature = await issueSignature(OTHER_0.address, rand);
    await ethosProfile
      .connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0)
      .registerAddress(OTHER_0.address, profileId, rand, signature);

    /* Set max addresses to 3 */
    await ethosProfile.connect(ADMIN).setMaxAddresses(3);

    /* Verifies that the addresses are 2 */
    let addresses = await ethosProfile.addressesForProfile(2);
    expect(addresses.length).to.be.equal(2, 'should be 2 addresses');

    /* Delete address at index 1 */
    await ethosProfile.connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0).deleteAddressAtIndex(1);

    /* Verifies that there is only 1 address */
    addresses = await ethosProfile.addressesForProfile(2);
    expect(addresses.length).to.be.equal(1, 'should be 1 address');
    expect(addresses[0]).to.be.equal(
      PROFILE_CREATOR_0.address,
      'wrong address[0]'
    );

    /* Restore the address */
    rand = '321';
    signature = await issueSignature(OTHER_0.address, rand);
    await ethosProfile
      .connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0)
      .registerAddress(OTHER_0.address, profileId, rand, signature);

    /* Verifies that the address is still marked as compromised */
    const isCompromised = await ethosProfile.isAddressCompromised(
      OTHER_0.address
    );
    expect(isCompromised).to.be.equal(true, 'should be true');

    /* Verifies that the address is still in the removed profiles */
    const profile = await ethosProfile.getProfile(profileId);
    expect(profile.removedAddresses.length).to.be.equal(1);

    /* Verifies that there are 2 addresses */
    addresses = await ethosProfile.addressesForProfile(2);
    expect(addresses.length).to.be.equal(2, 'should be 2 addresses');
    expect(addresses[0]).to.be.equal(
      PROFILE_CREATOR_0.address,
      'wrong address[0]'
    );
    expect(addresses[1]).to.be.equal(OTHER_0.address, 'wrong address[1]');

    /* Verifies that a user cannot register 3rd address */
    rand = '333';
    signature = await issueSignature(OTHER_1.address, rand);
    await expect(
      ethosProfile
        .connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0)
        .registerAddress(OTHER_1.address, profileId, rand, signature)
    ).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(ethosProfile, 'MaxAddressesReached');
  });
});
```

### Mitigation

Inside [`EthosProfile::registerAddress`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L373), remove the restored address from the `removeAddresses` array, if exists there, and consider marking the address as not compromised, because the user is restoring it and he expects to be able to interact with it
