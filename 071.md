# Incorrect handling of payments Making it impossible to pay Review Price

### Summary

When adding a review a user pays a protocol fee that is set by the admin team using the set paymentToken. There is a problem on the way the `_handlePayment`  function handles payment for reviews, it does a checks below:

```solidity 
function _handlePayment(address paymentToken) private onlyValidPaymentToken(paymentToken) {
    uint256 price = reviewPrice[paymentToken].price;

    if (price > 0) {
        if (paymentToken == address(0)) {
           if (msg.value != price) {
            revert WrongPaymentAmount(paymentToken, msg.value);
         }
      } else {
        if (msg.value > 0) {

          revert WrongPaymentAmount(address(0), msg.value);
        }

        IERC20(paymentToken).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), price);
      }
    }
  }

```
At first it checks if `price > 0`, then if `msg.value` ain't equal to price it will revert and move to the else block which will also revert if `msg.value > 0`. This means that payments will not be handled when price is more than 0.  This will make the protocol unable to receive deposits.

### Root Cause

Using the wrong check on msg.value as shown below
```javascript
if (msg.value > 0) {
    revert WrongPaymentAmount(address(0),msg.value);
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

The price of creating a review should be more than 0


### External pre-conditions

User wants to pay for the review using the payment tokens' set `price`

### Attack Path

1. Admin sets review price to 2USDT where USDT is the payment token.
2. Bob a user who has an `EthosProfile` wants to add a review to Alices' user address(subject) 
3. The `_handlePayment` internal function will be called with the address of the PaymentToken..
4. On Bob paying the 2USDT the transaction will revert because of the check below where by msg.value should not be more than 0.
```solidity
         if (msg.value > 0) {
             revert WrongPaymentAmount(address(0), msg.value);
        }

```
With this the protocol won't be able to receive the review fees amount


### Impact

- Protocol will not be able to correct review fees because it'll be impossible to pay price more than 0

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
    function _handlePayment(address paymentToken) private onlyValidPaymentToken(paymentToken) {
    uint256 price = reviewPrice[paymentToken].price;

    if (price > 0) {
        if (paymentToken == address(0)) {
           if (msg.value != price) {
            revert WrongPaymentAmount(paymentToken, msg.value);
         }
      } else {
--      if (msg.value > 0) {
++      if (msg.value <= 0) {

          revert WrongPaymentAmount(address(0), msg.value);
        }

        IERC20(paymentToken).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), price);
      }
    }
  }

```
