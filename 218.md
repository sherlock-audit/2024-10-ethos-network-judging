# Missing signature expiration

### Summary

In the `Ethos` system users can register addresses and create attestations using a signature issued by the `Ethos`.
The signed message although does not include expiration and the signature will be valid indefinitely as seen in the [`EthosAttestation::_keccakForCreateAttestation`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L521):

```javascript
 function _keccakForCreateAttestation(
        uint256 profileId,
        uint256 randValue,
        string calldata account,
        string calldata service,
        string calldata evidence
    ) private pure returns (bytes32) {
        return keccak256(abi.encodePacked(profileId, randValue, account, service, evidence));
    }
```

This can lead to stolen identity if Alice sells her account to Bob one but before selling it, she issued a signature for creating and attestation

### Root Cause

- Missing expiration timestamp in the signed message for creating attestation [`EthosAttestation::_keccakForCreateAttestation`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L521)
- Missing expiration timestamp in the signed message for registerring address [`EthosProfile::registerAddress`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L659)

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Alice creates a profile in `Ethos`
2. Alice obtains a signature for a profile in X: `cool/x.com`
3. Alice sells the profile to Bob
4. Alice submits a transaction for creating an attestation

### Impact

A user may steal another user's identity by creating an attestation and submitting after the other user posseses the attestation account

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Include expiration time inside the signed message for creating attestation and registerring an address.
