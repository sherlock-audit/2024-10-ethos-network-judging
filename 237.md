# User is able to uninvite addresses even when contracts are paused

### Summary

At every state changing function `whenNotPaused` modifier is added. However it is missing from the [uninviteUser()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L258), which will permit the user to change the contract state even when paused.

### Root Cause

Missing `whenNotPaused` modifier in [uninviteUser()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L258).

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Contracts are paused
2. User have active invites

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User calls the `uninviteUser()`

### Impact

The user is able to change the state of the contract when it is paused.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add `whenNotPaused` modifier.
