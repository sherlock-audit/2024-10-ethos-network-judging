# Restored addresses will not be able to take any action on behalf of the profile due to still being marked as compromised

## Summary

When an address is restored after being deleted due to being compromised, it remains marked as compromised in the `isAddressCompromised` mapping.
This prevents the address from taking any actions on behalf of the profile, even though it should be able to.

## Vulnerability Detail

When an address is compromised, it can be deleted by calling `EthosProfile::deleteAddressAtIndex()`, which marks the address as compromised in the `isAddressCompromised` mapping.

```solidity
  function deleteAddressAtIndex(uint256 addressIndex) external whenNotPaused {
    ... ...
    isAddressCompromised[addressStr] = true;
    ... ...
  }
```

The purpose of the `isAddressCompromised` mapping is to ensure that no address marked as compromised and deleted can take any action on behalf of the profile. If a previously deleted address is no longer compromised, it can be restored when an address associated with the same profile as the deleted address calls `EthosProfile::registerAddress()` and provides that address.

However, the address is not unmarked in `isAddressCompromised`, meaning that restored addresses will still be unable to take any actions on behalf of the profile as they remain flagged as compromised.

### Attack Path

1. AddressA calls `EthosProfile::registerAddress()` to register AddressB.
2. AddressB is compromised.
3. AddressA calls `EthosProfile::deleteAddressAtIndex()` to delete AddressB and mark it as compromised in `isAddressCompromised`.
4. AddressB is no longer compromised.
5. AddressA calls `EthosProfile::registerAddress()` to restore AddressB.
6. AddressB remains marked as compromised in `isAddressCompromised` and cannot act on behalf of the profile, even though it should be able to.

### Impact

A previously deleted address will not be able to take any action on behalf of the profile when restored, as it remains marked as compromised.

### Recommendation

Consider unmarking addresses as compromised when they are restored. If it is necessary to store the addresses that were removed in the past, this should be managed with a separate mapping.
