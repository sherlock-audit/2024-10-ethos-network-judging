# Wrong address removal operation in `EthosProfile.sol`

### Summary

In Ethos Social Network, users can remove addresses if they want using remove functionality. Ethos profile contract sets those accounts as compromised and adds through `removedAddresses` list variable. But in current implementation, it adds incorrect address to list in the function

### Root Cause

In [Ethos Profile Contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L584C1-L593C4), `_deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray` function swap the deleted address with the last index of the list and removes the last index from the list. While doing that, it also adds this removed address to `removedAddresses` list variable. But in current implementation it adds the last item to the list.

```solidity
  function _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray(
    uint256 index,
    address[] storage addresses,
    address[] storage removedAddresses
  ) private {
    address addr = addresses[addresses.length - 1];
    addresses[index] = addr;
@>  removedAddresses.push(addr);
    addresses.pop();
  }
```

Medium - Actually, there is no on-chain impact because this variable is not used anywhere. But this is a Social Network protocol and it will directly affect the user interface in the network.


### Mitigation

Add correct item to the `removedAddresses` variable
