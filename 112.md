# User won't able to re-register his account, if admin changes number of allowed addresses.

### Summary

The problems is in `registerAddress()` that **there is no logic that is differentiating** registering a new address or re-registering.

If we have 10 non-compromised addresses and 2 compromised, we may want to change one of the compromised to a non-compromised, but if the `Admin` has invoked `setMaxAddresses()` and has changed the maximum from 15 to 10, we wouldn't be able to change back the state of the address to a non-compromised one, even though **we don't create a new address**.

### Root Cause

Root cause is that **there's no logic differentiating** a creation of new address or re-registering an already existing address in `registerAddress()`.

`checkMaxAddresses()` is a must if we are creating a new address, but it shouldn't be present if we are re-registering

### Internal pre-conditions

We need to have enough addresses, so when the `Admin` invokes `setMaxAddresses()`, the new number of addresses needs to be lower than the [total of our addresses](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L732)

I will go with the value of 15 total addresses before then invocation of `setMaxAddresses()` and then the value will be 10 - for the purpose of the attack path

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. `Alice` has 12 addresses that are all `non-compromised` and 0 `compromised`
2. She decides that 2 of her addresses need to be compromised and invokes `deleteAddressAtIndex()` two times passing id1 and id2 in the invocations
3. `Admin` decides that the current limit of 15 addresses is too much and decides to make it 11
4. Time passes and `Alice` thinks about returning those two `compromised` addresses to a `non-compromised` state - etc. valid.
She decides to call `registerAddress()` to change the state of her addresses to a valid one, but she encounters [this function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L406) which will calculate that her total addresses are more and she won't be able to re-register her `compromised` address back to a `non-compromised`

### Impact

Users will be unable to bring back a compromised account to a non-compromised account.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add another param in `registerAddress()` to differentiate if the user wants to register a new address, or re-register an already existing one.
