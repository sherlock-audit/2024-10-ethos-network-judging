# EthosDiscussion :: addReply() isTargetThisContract is incorrectly set when a reply is created.

### Summary

**`addReply()`** is used to create a reply. However, there's an issue: when the **`Reply`** struct is created, **`isTargetThisContract`** is incorrectly set to **`false`** when the target is **`address(this)`** and **`true`** otherwise.

### Root Cause

[addReply()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosReview.sol#L173-L219) is implemented as follows:
```Solidity
function addReply(
    address targetContract,
    uint256 targetId,
    string memory content,
    string memory metadata
  ) external onlyNonZeroAddress(targetContract) whenNotPaused {
    uint256 authorID = IEthosProfile(
      contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(ETHOS_PROFILE)
    ).verifiedProfileIdForAddress(msg.sender);

@>  bool isTargetThisContract = _isAddressThisContract(targetContract);

    //reply a reply
    if (isTargetThisContract) {
      if (replies[targetId].createdAt == 0) {
        revert TargetNotFound(targetContract, targetId);
      }
    } else {
      _checkIfTargetExistsAndAllowed(targetContract, targetId);
    }

    uint256 _replyCount = replyCount;

    directReplyIdsByTargetAddressAndTargetId[targetContract][targetId].push(_replyCount);
    replyIdsByAuthor[authorID].push(_replyCount);

    replies[_replyCount] = Reply(
@>    !isTargetThisContract, 
      targetContract,
      authorID,
      _replyCount,
      targetId,
      block.timestamp,
      0,
      content,
      metadata
    );

    emit ReplyAdded(authorID, targetContract, _replyCount);

    replyCount++;
  }
```
As shown, **`_isAddressThisContract()`** is called to determine the value of **`isTargetThisContract`**.
```Solidity
function _isAddressThisContract(address targetContract) private view returns (bool) {
    return targetContract == address(this);
  }
```
**`_isAddressThisContract()`** returns **`true`** if the target contract is **`address(this)`**. However, as seen in the creation of the **`Reply`** struct, the `isTargetThisContract` boolean is incorrectly negated when **`targetContract == address(this)`**.


### Internal pre-conditions

**`addReply()`** is called with **`targetContract == address(this)`**.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None.

### Impact

The **`Reply`** struct is incorrectly created when **`targetContract == address(this)`**, as **`isTargetThisContract`** is set to **`false`**. This misconfiguration can lead to issues on the front end.

### PoC

The previous sections justify the vulnerability.

### Mitigation

Remove the negation of  **`isTargetThisContract`** when creating the **`Reply`** struct.
