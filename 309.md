Invalid

# Anyone with a profile will have unlimited number of invites and can swing votes in their favor

#### Summary
The uninviteUser function does not check whether an address has already registered a profile before uninviting the user . When called, it adds back the invite you had used up even though the address is already registered.

#### Root Cause
The function lacks a check to see if the user has already registered a profile before uninviting them.

#### Internal Pre-Conditions
An address needs to be invited then registered first then the invitee can uninvite that address and gain back their invite.

#### Impact
User can have an unlimited number of profiles that can swing votes in their favor

#### Mitigation
```solidity
function uninviteUser(address user) external {
    require(profileIdByAddress[user] == 0, "User already registered");
    // Continue to uninvite the user and reclaim the invite
}
```
