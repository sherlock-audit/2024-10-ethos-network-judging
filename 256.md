# Failure to Handle Token Transfer with safeTransfer in _handlePayment Function

### Summary

The _handlePayment function in Ethosreview.sol fails to handle token transfers using safeTransfer. This can lead to potential issues with token transfers, including failed transactions and loss of funds.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this issue is the use of transferFrom instead of safeTransferFrom for ERC-20 token transfers. The transferFrom function does not handle all possible failure scenarios, which can result in unsuccessful transfers without proper error handling.

```solidity
  function _handlePayment(address paymentToken) private onlyValidPaymentToken(paymentToken) {
    uint256 price = reviewPrice[paymentToken].price;

    if (price > 0) {
      if (paymentToken == address(0)) {
        if (msg.value != price) {//Strict value
          revert WrongPaymentAmount(paymentToken, msg.value);
        }
      } else {
        if (msg.value > 0) {
          revert WrongPaymentAmount(address(0), msg.value);
        }

        IERC20(paymentToken).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), price);
      }
    }
  }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

For ERC-20 token payments, the function attempts to transfer tokens from the sender to the contract using transferFrom, which is obviously the case in the _handlePayment() function

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

-A user initiates a payment with an ERC-20 token.
-The _handlePayment function calls transferFrom to transfer the tokens.
-If the token transfer fails,  the function does not handle the failure properly, leading to potential loss of funds or failed transactions.

### Impact

The function may fail to transfer tokens without proper error handling, leading to failed transactions.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Replace transferFrom with safeTransferFrom to ensure proper handling of token transfers and to revert the transaction in case of failure.
