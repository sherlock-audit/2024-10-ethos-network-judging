# No one is able to claim Attestations

### Summary

The `_claimAttestation` function will not let anyone claim existing attestations.

### Root Cause

In `EthosAttestation.sol` the [_claimAttestation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L269) function is set to `private`.

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

### Impact

If a user proves they own an attestation, they should be able to claim it. This is not possible if `_claimAttestation` is `private`.

### PoC
