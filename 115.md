# Possibility to add an address to a profile without mutual consent

### Summary

The `registerAddress` function in the smart contract lacks mutual consent verification between the profile owner and the address being registered. This allows either unauthorized profile access or burning addresses without permission, depending on the backend implementation.

[EthosProfile.registerAddress](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/979e352d7bcdba3d0665f11c0320041ce28d1b89/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L373-L373)

### Root Cause

The core issue lies in the signature verification model: the contract only validates a single backend-generated signature based on `(address, profileId, randValue)` parameters. There is no mechanism to verify that both parties (profile owner and address being registered) have consented to this registration.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Profile exists in the system
2. Contract has `registerAddress` function:
```solidity
function registerAddress(
    address addressStr,
    uint256 profileId,
    uint256 randValue,
    bytes calldata signature
)
```
3. Once an address is registered to a profile, it cannot be registered to another profile (address is "burned")

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

**Scenario 1: Unauthorized Profile Access**
If backend doesn't verify profile ownership:

1. Attacker identifies target profileId
2. Attacker calls backend API:
```typescript
POST /api/register-address
body: {
    addressStr: ATTACKER_ADDRESS,
    profileId: TARGET_PROFILE_ID
}
```
3. Backend generates valid signature
4. Attacker executes `registerAddress` with received signature
5. Attacker gains access to target profile

**Scenario 2: Burning Victim's Address**
If backend only verifies profile ownership:

1. Malicious profile owner selects victim's address
2. Profile owner calls backend API:
```typescript
POST /api/register-address
body: {
    addressStr: VICTIM_ADDRESS,
    profileId: ATTACKER_PROFILE_ID
}
```
3. Backend generates valid signature (since profile owner is authorized)
4. Attacker executes `registerAddress`
5. Victim's address is permanently bound to attacker's profile without consent

_Note: The example backend API implementations have been stripped down to the bare minimum of input data._

### Impact

Useless core function `registerAddress`.

**Medium severity** based on:

1. Breaching security by allowing unauthorized access to a profile, through which the system can be used on behalf of the profile - writing reviews, voting, adding and archiving attestations, etc.
2. Once an address has been added to a profile, it cannot be undone, which prevents victims from registering using legitimate profiles, meaning the address is permanently "burned".

### Mitigation

1. Split registration into three steps:
   - Owner initiates registration
   - New address accepts registration
   - Backend generates signature only after both consents are verified

1. Add time limits and consent revocation options:
   - Set expiration for pending registrations
   - Allow both parties to cancel registration before finalization
