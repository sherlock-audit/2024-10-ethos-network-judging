# Inaccurate Profile Verification Logic Leads to Misclassification of Mock Profiles

### Summary

The Ethos protocol's [profileStatusById]() function fails to correctly differentiate between verified and mock profiles. As a result, mock profiles, which should not be granted the same permissions as verified profiles, may be allowed to initiate transactions or create new profiles. This misclassification compromises the core principle of user credibility within the Ethos social contract, risking trust among users.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L501C3-L508C4

In `EthosProfile.sol:501`, there is a flaw in the verification logic in the `profileStatusById` function.
During profile creation, createProfile function is called by anyone as shown here;
```solidity
function createProfile(uint256 inviterId) external whenNotPaused {
    (
      bool inviteSenderVerified,
      bool inviteSenderArchived,
      bool inviteSenderIsMock
    ) = profileStatusById(inviterId);
    if (!inviteSenderVerified || inviteSenderArchived || inviteSenderIsMock) {
      revert InvalidSender();
    }
    _inviterProfileAuthorizedSender(inviterId, msg.sender);
```

This makes a call to `profileStatusById(inviterId)` where the issue lies.
```solidty
function profileStatusById(
    uint256 profileId
  ) public view returns (bool verified, bool archived, bool mock) {
    Profile storage profile = profiles[profileId];
    verified = profile.profileId > 0;
    archived = verified && profile.archived;
    mock = profileId > 0 && !verified && profileId < profileCount;
  }
```
Now when ProfileStatusId is triggered and wants to check if a profile is a mock profile, it checks if the profile count is greater than the profile Id which is correct because the profile count is incremented at the end of mock profile creation. To understand this better, let's look at how mock profiles are created;
```solidity
function incrementProfileCount(
    bool isAttestation,
    address subject,
    bytes32 attestation
  ) external whenNotPaused returns (uint256 profileId) {
    if (
      msg.sender != contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(ETHOS_REVIEW) &&
      msg.sender != contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(ETHOS_ATTESTATION)
    ) {
      revert InvalidSender();
    }
    profileId = profileCount;
    if (isAttestation) {
      profileIdByAttestation[attestation] = profileId;
    } else {
      profileIdByAddress[subject] = profileId;
    }
    profileCount++;

    emit MockProfileCreated(profileId);
  }
```
Also, it will also check if `profileId` is greater than zero and it will pass the check because the profile id was assigned to profile count which is non-zero in the mock creation. But the issue arises when checking `!verified` in `profileSttatusbyId` function. From the code here, you can see that verified =profile.profileId > 0 . So when it gets to this part of the code;
```solidity
 mock = profileId > 0 && !verified && profileId < profileCount;
```
!verified will be false because profileId > 0, hence it will fail to flag the profile as mock even when it is mock. It requires that all the conditions be true before it is flagged as mock.

Now it will pass as verified because profileId > 0 for even a mock profile.

The issue arises from the verification logic in the `profileStatusById` function, where the determination of a profile's verification status is based solely on whether the profileId is greater than zero. This approach does not account for mock profiles that also have a valid (non-zero) profileId, leading to an incorrect identification as verified profiles.

### Internal pre-conditions

 The profileId for mock profiles is set to the current value of profileCount, which is always greater than zero when a profile is created.

### External pre-conditions

Users or contracts interact with the Ethos protocol to create profiles and conduct transactions based on the  verification of their profiles

### Attack Path

    1. An attacker creates a mock profile.
    2. The attacker then attempts to perform actions creating new profiles that are only permitted for verified profiles with a valid invite.
    3. The flawed verification logic allows the mock profile to pass as verified due to its non-zero profileId and `!verified` check, thereby granting unauthorized access.

### Impact

This vulnerability allows mock profiles to be erroneously classified as verified profiles, potentially enabling untrusted users to perform actions that undermine the credibility of the Ethos protocol and the safety of user transactions. The severe impacts include:
   1. Increased Fraud Risk: With the ability for mock profiles to perform actions typically reserved for verified profiles, there is a heightened risk of fraud, scams, and malicious activities, endangering the financial and reputational well-being of users. 
   2. This breaks a core property and invariant of the protocol by allowing mock profile to perform actions like Create profile when invited, invite address and other critical roles meant only for verified profiles.
   3. Compromised Transaction Integrity: Transactions between users may be executed under false pretenses, resulting in financial losses and disputes that can escalate into larger issues within the community.
    4. Reputational Damage: The Ethos protocol could suffer significant reputational harm, making it less attractive to new users and potential partners, ultimately impacting long-term growth and sustainability.
   

### PoC

    1. Deploy the Ethos contract and create a mock profile.
    2. Observe that the newly created mock profile has a profileId that is greater than zero.
    3. Call the profileStatusById function for the mock profile and check that it incorrectly returns as verified.
    4. Attempt to invoke a sensitive function that requires a verified profile like create profile, invite address etc, demonstrating that the mock profile can bypass access controls.

### Mitigation

1. Improve Status Checking Logic by:
    • Update the logic in profileStatusById to correctly identify mock profiles and ensure that verified reflects true verification status. This can include adding an explicit field to the Profile struct, as previously discussed.
    • Explicit State Management:
        ◦ Introduce an additional state or flag in the Profile struct that explicitly marks whether a profile is verified or mock.
       

```solidity
       struct Profile {
           uint256 profileId;
           bool archived;
           bool isMock;  // New field to explicitly define mock status
       }
```
Then,     
2. Change Verification Logic:
        ◦ Modify the verification logic in the profileStatusById function to incorporate additional criteria for determining if a profile is mock.
       
```solidity
       verified = profile.profileId > 0 && !profile.isMock; // Only consider non-mock profiles as verified
```

Or
3. Remove the !verified check because it is directly contracdicting profileId > 0
Instead of this;
```solidity
mock = profileId > 0 && !verified && profileId < profileCount;
```
Use this;
```solidity
mock = profileId > 0 && profileId < profileCount;
```
