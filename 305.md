# Unauthorized `Attestations` Allowed for Archived Profiles in `EthosAttestation` Contract

### Summary

The missing validation of profile activity status(archived) in `createAttestation` will cause unauthorized attestations for archived profiles as an attacker can exploit this flaw to create or claim attestations under archived profiles.

### Root Cause

In `EthosAttestation`, the contract lacks a check for the profile’s active status in the `createAttestation` function:
 the function checks for profile existence but does not verify if the profile is archived

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The `profileId` must exist within the `EthosProfile` contract.
2. The attestation’s `hashStr` should not already be active (i.e., should be archived).
3. The caller must have a valid signature for the attestation.

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The affected protocol suffers from unauthorized attestations under archived profiles, potentially damaging the integrity of the Ethos identity system. An attacker could associate false or outdated information with archived profiles, compromising the credibility of the profile data.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a check for the profile’s active status in createAttestation to ensure that only active profiles can create attestation
