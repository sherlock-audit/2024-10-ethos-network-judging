# Unauthorized register of address

### Summary

The `EthosProfile` accepts address registration by accepting a signature for the address, the profile to which the address will be attached and a random value. The signature is issued by the Ethos' `expectedSigner`, but if the `expectedSigner` misvalidates that the address belongs to the provided profile, the user can register that address because there is no signature verification from the provided address.

### Root Cause

In ['EthosProfile:sol:373`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L373) the function is missing a signature and a message by the address being registered

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- Alice pretend to own addres B
- The Ethos system fails to validate that address B belongs to the Alice
- The Ethos system issues a signature for address B, Alice's profile and a random value
- Alice registers the address B as hers without providing a signature for a message from address B

### Impact

Users may register an address that does not belong to them.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The registered address should accept a signature and a signed message to verify that the address has signed the message.
