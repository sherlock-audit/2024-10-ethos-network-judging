# Anybody can register their address with a particular `profileId`

### Impact

Anybody can register their address with a particular `profileId`.\
Make it vulnerable to control the profile by anyone.

### PoC

There is no check if the profileID belongs to owner of the ProfileID who is trying to register an address.

```solidity
  function registerAddress(
    address addressStr,
    uint256 profileId,
    uint256 randValue,
    bytes calldata signature
  ) external whenNotPaused onlyNonZeroAddress(addressStr) {
    (bool verified, bool archived, bool mock) = profileStatusById(profileId);
    if (!verified) {
      revert ProfileNotFound(profileId);
    }
    if (archived || mock) {
      revert ProfileAccess(profileId, "Profile is archived");
    }
    // you may restore your own previously deleted address,
    // but you cannot register an address that has been deleted by another user
    if (profileIdByAddress[addressStr] != profileId && isAddressCompromised[addressStr]) {
      revert AddressCompromised(addressStr);
    }
    (bool addressAlreadyRegistered, , , uint256 registeredProfileId) = profileStatusByAddress(
      addressStr
    );
    if (addressAlreadyRegistered && registeredProfileId != profileId) {
      revert ProfileExistsForAddress(addressStr);
    }

    validateAndSaveSignature(
      _keccakForRegisterAddress(addressStr, profileId, randValue),
      signature
    );

    profiles[profileId].addresses.push(addressStr);
    profileIdByAddress[addressStr] = profileId;

    checkMaxAddresses(profileId);

    emit AddressClaim(profileId, addressStr, AddressClaimStatus.Claimed);
  }
```

### Mitigation

Please add some cases, if it does not belong to the owner of the ProfileID it will revert.
