# An attacker can use a single address to create numerous profiles for fraudulent purposes

### Summary

So typically a single address can be used create numerous profiles thereby giving an attacker the incentive to misbehave and act inappropriately on Ethos because he has other profiles which he created with the same address.
This becomes more interesting because when he creates the first one he can invite himself, again and again. This is because there is no where in the create profile function where an address is checked whether it has been used before to create profile or associated with a profile.

### Root Cause

In `ethosProfile.sol:I58`, there is no where in the create profile function where an address is checked whether it has been used before to create profile or associated with a profile. Hence an attacker can create numerous profiles with the same address.

while it is true that it checks if a profile already exist but it fails check the address of a profile if it has been used before as seen here;
```solidity
function createProfile(uint256 inviterId) external whenNotPaused {
    (
      bool inviteSenderVerified,
      bool inviteSenderArchived,
      bool inviteSenderIsMock
    ) = profileStatusById(inviterId);
    if (!inviteSenderVerified || inviteSenderArchived || inviteSenderIsMock) {
      revert InvalidSender();
    }
    _inviterProfileAuthorizedSender(inviterId, msg.sender);

    uint256 newID = _createProfile(msg.sender);
    profiles[newID].inviteInfo.invitedBy = inviterId;
    profiles[inviterId].inviteInfo.acceptedIds.push(newID);
  }

```

```solidity
function _createProfile(address user) internal returns (uint256 profileId) {
    (bool verified, , bool mock, uint256 existingProfileId) = profileStatusByAddress(user);
    if (verified) {
      revert ProfileExists(existingProfileId);
    } else if (mock) {
      profileId = existingProfileId;
    } else {
      profileId = profileCount;
      profileCount++;
    }

    profileIdByAddress[user] = profileId;
    profiles[profileId].profileId = profileId;
    profiles[profileId].createdAt = block.timestamp;
    profiles[profileId].inviteInfo.available = defaultNumberOfInvites;
    profiles[profileId].addresses.push(user);

    emit ProfileCreated(profileId, user);
    return profileId;
  }

```

### Internal pre-conditions

No check for address that is already associated with a profile being used again.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. An attacker calls createProfile with a valid invite
2. After successfully completing the profiles, he sends himself an invite.
3. Calls create profile again with a valid invite 
4. It successfully works because there is no explicit check if the address has been used before
5. Repeat as many times as possible

### Impact

1. This breaks the main invariant stated by the protocol: "One address may be associated with maximum one profile."
2. An attacker has the incentive to misbehave and act inappropriately on Ethos because he has other profiles which he created with the same address. Even when he is flagged down, he can simply move to his other accounts

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a check in create Profile function that would check if the address being used for the profile creation is already associated with a verified profile before a new profile is created.

Something similar to the check in register function
```solidty
For mitigation; maybe something like this used in register function: if (profileIdByAddress[addressStr] != profileId && isAddressCompromised[addressStr]) {
revert AddressCompromised(addressStr);
}
(bool addressAlreadyRegistered, , , uint256 registeredProfileId) = profileStatusByAddress(
addressStr
);
if (addressAlreadyRegistered && registeredProfileId != profileId) {
revert ProfileExistsForAddress(addressStr);
}
```
