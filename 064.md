# Re-registering an account doesn't reset it

### Summary

In the removal of an address, we mark it as [isAddressCompromised[addressStr] = true;](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L432)

In `registerAddress()`, it is said in the comment above the declaration that an address can be re-registered, but the reset of the `isAddressCompromised[addressStr]` is nowhere to be seen.

### Root Cause

The root cause is the missing reset of the `isAddressCompromised[addressStr]` in the `registerAddress()`.



### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Once an address has been deleted, it will never be uncompromised, thus preventing a legitimate user interacting with certain parts of the application.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Reset the mapping instance to false in the process of re-registering an address.
