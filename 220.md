# Attacker Could Forge Service Attestation Identity Through Hash Collision

### Summary

Use of `abi.encodePacked` for hashing service and account strings will cause an attestation compromise for legitimate Ethos users as malicious actors will exploit hash collisions to claim existing attestations by obtaining valid signatures for crafted service/account name combinations that hash to the same value.

### Root Cause

In [`EthosAttestation.sol:435`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L435) the use of `abi.encodePacked` in `getServiceAndAccountHash` function for concatenating variable-length strings service and account creates hash collisions:

```solidity
function getServiceAndAccountHash(
    string calldata service,
    string calldata account
) public pure returns (bytes32) {
    if (bytes(service).length == 0 || bytes(account).length == 0) {
        revert AttestationInvalid(service, account);
    }
    return keccak256(abi.encodePacked(service, account));  // Vulnerable line
}
```

This root cause is what enables:
1. The ability to find different service/account combinations that hash to the same value
2. The possibility of claiming legitimate attestations through these collisions
3. The bypass of signature verification since it checks raw values but claiming uses the collided hash

### Impact

The legitimate Ethos user loses control of their service attestation permanently. The attacker gains ownership of the legitimate user's attestation and can now prove association with that service/account combination.

More specifically:
1. Initial owner loses:
   - Control over their service attestation
   - Ability to archive/restore the attestation
   - Association between their profile and the service
   
2. Attacker gains:
   - Full control over the legitimate attestation
   - Ability to prove association with the original service
   - Capability to maintain this control indefinitely since ownership transfer is permanent

This could be particularly impactful for high-value attestations like verified Twitter accounts, Discord servers, or other web2 service verifications that are used for reputation or access control within the Ethos ecosystem.

### Mitigation

use `abi.encode` instead of `abi.encodePacked` to prevent this collision
