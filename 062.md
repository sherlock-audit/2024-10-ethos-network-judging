# Compromised addresses should be prevented from interacting with any functions that are available to addresses that have no compromised flag on them.

### Summary

**Lack of checks** if an address is compromised in functions such as [addReview()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosReview.sol#L173-L219), which makes the flag useless to some extent, that should've been prevented.

### Root Cause

**Lack of checks** if an address is compromised in functions such as `addReview()`, which makes the flag useless to some extent.

It should **clearly prevent such interactions**, the only interaction it prevents is in `inviteAddress()` and re-registering

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Compromised addresses can call the same functions as normal addresses, which makes the flag practically useless.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add checks in functions that should clearly not be called by a compromised addresses.
