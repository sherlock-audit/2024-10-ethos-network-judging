# Restored addresses will be double-counted on the user's Profile

### Summary

The `EthosProfile::registerAddress()` function allows users to add addresses to their profiles, either as new entries or by restoring previously deleted ones. However, when a user restores an address they previously removed, this address remains in `Profile.removedAddresses` instead of being deleted. As a result, it is counted twice, once in `Profile.addresses` and once in `Profile.removedAddresses`, leading to an incorrect limitation on the total number of addresses a user can register.

### Root Cause

The `registerAddress()` function explicitly allows the user to [restore previously deleted addresses](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L386-L387):
```solidity
    // you may restore your own previously deleted address,
    // but you cannot register an address that has been deleted by another user
    if (profileIdByAddress[addressStr] != profileId && isAddressCompromised[addressStr]) {
      revert AddressCompromised(addressStr);
    }
```

However, the function does not remove the restored address from `Profile.removedAddresses`. This leads to a situation where the same address is counted in both `Profile.addresses` and `Profile.removedAddresses`, wrongly reducing the user's [maximum addresses](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L732-L738):
```solidity
  function checkMaxAddresses(uint256 profileId) internal view {
    uint256 sum = profiles[profileId].addresses.length;
    sum += profiles[profileId].removedAddresses.length;
    if (sum > maxNumberOfAddresses) {
      revert MaxAddressesReached(profileId);
    }
  }
```


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

The user must restore a previously deleted address.


### Attack Path

The default limit of addresses is 128.

1. Assume a user has 127 active addresses on `Profile.addresses` and 1 removed address on `Profile.removedAddresses`
2. Assume the user decides to restore the previously deleted address via `EthosProfile::registerAddress()`
3. The user's transaction will revert with a `MaxAddressesReached` error, as the removed address will be added to `Profile.addresses`, making it 128 addresses, but will not be removed from `Profile.removedAddresses`, thus being double counted


### Impact

Once `Profile.addresses` + `Profile.removedAddresses` reaches `maxNumberOfAddresses`, users are blocked from restoring any deleted addresses.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Include logic in `EthosProfile::registerAddress()` to remove the address from the array of `removedAddresses` when restoring an address.
