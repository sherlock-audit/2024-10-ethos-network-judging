# Users can review their own address/attestation, then later add it to their own profileId.


### Summary

Users should not be able to review their own address or attestation. However, since currently it is able to review an address/attestation without a profileId (a mock profileId would be generated), users can later register/claim the address/attestation to their profileId.

This is equivalent to reviewing their own address/attestation. The current mechanism has no way to prevent this.

### Root Cause

The key is when claiming an attestation or registering an address to a profileId, there is no logic to remove the self-reviews. It can be easily checked if we iterate through the reviews of mock profileId and see if the reviewer is the same as the user profileId. 

Following is the code that avoids normal self-review (i.e. the attestation or address already belongs to the user profileId). But users can bypass this easily by creating a mock profileId.

Users can use this mechanism to self-review his own address or attestation within the same profileId.

### Mitigation

When claiming an attestation or registering an address to profileId, we should iterate through the reviews of mock profileId and remove the review if the reviewer is the same as the profileId.
