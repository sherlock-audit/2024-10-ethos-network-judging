# Prevent other users from creating profiles by preemptively pre-empting the addresses of users invited by `registerAddress`

### Summary

It appears that the off-chain functionality to retrieve the `signature` currently used for `registerAddress` is not implemented yet. However, I have reported this as a vulnerability because an important verification process is missing in the smart contract.
```solidity
  function registerAddress(
    address addressStr,
    uint256 profileId,
    uint256 randValue,
    bytes calldata signature
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol

Once an address is registered with `registerAddress`, it cannot be removed, and there may be a problem because there is no signature verification process within the contract to verify that the caller is the owner of `addressStr`.

The address registered with `registerAddress` is registered to `profileIdByAddress`, and it becomes impossible to create a profile with that address. Because in `_createProfile`, the address registered to `profileIdByAddress` is reverted because it already exists.
```solidity
  function profileStatusByAddress(
    address addressStr
  ) public view returns (bool verified, bool archived, bool mock, uint256 profileId) {
    profileId = profileIdByAddress[addressStr];
  ...
  function _createProfile(address user) internal returns (uint256 profileId) {
    (bool verified, , bool mock, uint256 existingProfileId) = profileStatusByAddress(user);
    if (verified) {
      revert ProfileExists(existingProfileId);
```

If you can obtain the `expectedSigner` signature from someone else's address off-chain, you can prevent that user from creating a profile by randomly registering invited users.

### Root Cause

Missing the step to verify owner of addressStr in `registerAddress`

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Invite a specific address with `inviteAddress` from the admin account.
2. Register the account you invited with `registerAddress` from another account.
3. Create a profile with `createProfile` using the invited account.
4. Make sure it is reverted with `ProfileExists`.

### Impact

An attacker can prevent others from creating profiles by preempting the invitee's address as the `registerAddress`.

        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(address(200));
        // revert with `ProfileExists`
        profile.createProfile(1);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
}

```

### Mitigation

It is need to input the signature value for `addressStr` and verify it within the smart contract.
