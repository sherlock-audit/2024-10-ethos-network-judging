# Function EthosReview.sol:withdrawFunds() does not support a recipient for withdrawal different than msg.sender

### Summary

[EthosReview.sol:withdrawFunds()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosReview.sol#L449) lets the contract owner withdraw funds but the only supported recipient is `msg.sender`

In case the contract owner is delegated to a contract, eg. Gnosis Multisig, the funds can be only transferred from `EthosReview` to the multisig contract and if it does not allow withdrawal and/or is not upgradeable, could lead to fund freezing
