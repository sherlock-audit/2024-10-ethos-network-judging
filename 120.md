# A malicious address can compromise absolutely every single address related to the profileId, thus making the real owner not able to act.

### Summary

The purpose of an address being compromised and set to `mapping isAddressCompromised[addr]=true` is if someone gain access to the address, he won't be able to do malicious things.

But if a malicious actor gets into one of the addresses, the first logical thing that he will do is mark the other legitimate addresses as compromised, thus **gaining full access** to the profile it is linked.

### Root Cause

The root cause is the current design of the protocol - it doesn't impose a limit on which a user can compromise another address in the same profile. I'd give my thoughts with an example - Let's say there is a profile with 3 addresses and 1 of them is somehow stolen, leaking of private key or a hack, etc.,  

There should be a **voting mechanism** in order to **not compromise** the other addresses.

If 2 addresses out of 3 vote that an address should be deleted, **then it is deleted**, so that if a malicious actor gets access to one of the address, he can't compromise and delete all of the other addresses related to the profile

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

A malicious actor gaining access to only one address which is connected to a profile with several addresses.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

If a malicious actor gains access **to only one of the addresses**, he can delete and
 compromise all of the remaining addresses in no time.

Solution would be a voting mechanism to ensure that one address can't delete the rest of them in one go.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Voting mechanism would be an ideal solution. If one user has access to 9/10 of the addresses and the malicious actor has access to the 10th, he can't delete/compromise the rest of the addresses linked to the specific profile.
