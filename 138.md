# Inconsistent Profile-Address Mapping During Address Deletion Operations

### Summary

Missing mapping updates in address deletion will cause an inconsistency in profile-to-address associations for profile owners, as malicious actors can exploit the mismatch between storage structures to gain unauthorized access or deny legitimate access to profiles.

### Root Cause

In `EthosProfile.sol:_deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray`, the function moves addresses in the array without updating the corresponding `profileIdByAddress` mapping, creating a data inconsistency.

```solidity

 function _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray(
    uint256 index,
    address[] storage addresses,
    address[] storage removedAddresses
) private {
    address addr = addresses[addresses.length - 1];
    addresses[index] = addr;
    removedAddresses.push(addr);
    addresses.pop();
    // Missing: profileIdByAddress[addr] = profileId
}

```

### Internal pre-conditions

- Profile needs to have at least 2 registered addresses.
- Profile owner needs to call `deleteAddressAtIndex()` to remove an address that isn't at the last position in the addresses array.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User has a profile with addresses `[A, B, C]`, where `profileIdByAddress` maps each to `profileId 1`.
2. User calls `deleteAddressAtIndex(1)` to remove address `B`.
3. Address `C` gets moved to index `1`, but `profileIdByAddress[C]` remains unchanged.
4. Future operations using address `C` may fail verification checks.
5. Profile system becomes increasingly inconsistent with each address deletion.

### Impact

Profile owners cannot reliably manage their addresses and may lose access to profile functionality. The system's address-to-profile associations become corrupted over time, affecting core profile verification features.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Update the _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray function to include profileId parameter and maintain mapping consistency:

```solidity

function _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray(
    uint256 index,
    address[] storage addresses,
    address[] storage removedAddresses,
    uint256 profileId
) private {
    address addr = addresses[addresses.length - 1];
    addresses[index] = addr;
    profileIdByAddress[addr] = profileId;
    removedAddresses.push(addr);
    addresses.pop();
}

```
