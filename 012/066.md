# Usage of array's length for an invite index is disastrous

### Summary

In `inviteAddress()`, we assign the invite index from the [array's length here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L231-L234).

But let's say we have invited 5 addresses - [addr1, addr2, addr3, addr4, addr5], if I decide to remove addr3 via `uninviteAddress()`,
we are going to have 4 addresses left.

If I then try to call `uninviteAddress()` second time, but with addr5 (remember, addr5 has the invite index assigned of 4)
it will revert due to [this check here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L231-L234)

### Root Cause

The root cause is assigning the [sentInviteIndexByProfileIdAndAddress](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L231-L234) with the length of the array and then having a check against the length of the array in `uninviteAddress()`.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. `Alice` invites five address using `inviteAddress()` [addr1, addr2, addr3, addr4, addr5]
2. `Alice` then decides to call `uninviteAddress()` for the addr3
3. `Alice` decides to call the `uninviteAddress()` a second time, but for the addr5
4. The function will revert due to it checking the invite index against the length of the array, which is susceptible to change

### Impact

`uninviteAddress()` will revert in the scenario specified in the summary or in a similar one.
