# When the profileId associated with an Attestation changes, the corresponding profileId in the related Review is not updated.

### Summary

When a Review is published for an Attestation, the Review will be linked to the profileId associated with that Attestation. If the Attestation has not yet been linked to a profile, a mockProfile will be created.
However, the association between an Attestation and a profile can change. When the profile linked to an Attestation is updated, the previously left comments are still tracked by the old profileId.

### Root Cause

In the `createAttestation` function, when calling the `assignExistingProfileToAttestation` function to change the association between the Attestation and the Profile, it does not query or update `reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId` to point the reviews associated with the Attestation to the new profileId and remove the related reviews from the old profileId.

### Internal pre-conditions

The association information between an Attestation and a profile has been modified.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Assume an Attestation initially has no associated profile. User1 writes `review1` for it, creating a mockProfile with `mockId = 10`. At this point, `reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId[10] = review1`.
2. User2 creates a new profile and calls `createAttestation`, linking the Attestation to their own `profileId 11`.
3. At this point, User1's previous review for the Attestation is still associated with `mockId = 10` (`reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId[10] = review1`), but `mockId` is no longer linked to any Attestation.
4. If User1 now writes another review (`review2`) for the Attestation, `review2` will point to `profileId 11`, so `reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId[11] = review2`.
5. User3 creates a new profile and calls `createAttestation`, linking the Attestation to their `profileId 12`.
6. User1's two reviews are associated with `profileId 10` and `11`, but neither of these profiles is currently linked to the Attestation.

At this point, if the evaluator wants to query the reviews related to the Attestation, since the current Attestation is linked to `profileId 12`, they will track `reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId[12]`. However, this mapping currently has no reviews associated with it.

### Impact

`reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId` will be unable to track all historical reviews related to the Attestation under the profile, which could impact the evaluation process.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

In the `assignExistingProfileToAttestation` function, the related reviews of the Attestation should be removed from `reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId[originalProfileId]` using `pop`, and then added to `reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId[newProfileId]` using `push`.
