# Archived/Deleted author could archive his/her review

### Summary

In archiveReview() code checks msg.sender directly to the review.author without checking if msg.sender is verified profile for address

### Root Cause

Before this part of the code
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosReview.sol#L300
We should have a check whether the address is valid for the protocol. Now without it unauthorized or deleted author may perform operations that he is not supposed to.
