# Missing `whenNotPaused` Modifier in `withdrawFunds` Function, Allowing Owner to Potentially Rug Pool During Emergency Situations

### Summary:
The `withdrawFunds` function lacks a `whenNotPaused` modifier, allowing the contract owner to withdraw funds even when the contract is `paused`. This increases the risk of potential misuse, including unauthorized or premature withdrawals during paused states, potentially raising concerns about the protocol's security and stability.

### Vulnerability Details:
The withdrawFunds function allows the contract owner to withdraw funds from the contract in both native currency (e.g., ETH) and ERC20 tokens. However, the absence of a  `whenNotPaused` modifier means that the owner can execute this function regardless of whether the contract is in a paused or active state. Pausing is typically intended to halt critical operations, including financial transactions, during an emergency or while the contract is undergoing maintenance or upgrades. `By enabling fund withdrawal during a paused state, this vulnerability increases the risk of potential misuse by the owner, such as unauthorized withdrawals, and can lead to reputational damage if users perceive this as an attempt to “rug” (steal) the protocol’s funds.`

### Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosReview.sol#L449-L455
```
// @audit-issue : missing whennotpaused . Owner can rug pool when contract is paused
  function withdrawFunds(address paymentToken) external onlyOwner {
    if (paymentToken == address(0)) {
      payable(msg.sender).transfer(address(this).balance);
    } else {
      IERC20(paymentToken).transfer(msg.sender, IERC20(paymentToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }
  }
```

### Impact:
The missing `whenNotPaused` modifier exposes the protocol to significant risk. The ability for an owner to withdraw funds during a paused state raises concerns about trust and security, as it bypasses the intended restrictions imposed by pausing. This could damage the protocol's credibility and lead to a loss of user confidence. Moreover, it could potentially open doors to malicious activity in scenarios where the contract is paused for security reasons.

### Recommendation:
Add the `whenNotPaused` modifier to the `withdrawFunds` function to prevent any fund withdrawals when the contract is paused. This ensures that the owner cannot withdraw funds during a paused state, maintaining trust in the protocol's security and enhancing protection against misuse.
