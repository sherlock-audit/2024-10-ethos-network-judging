# Loss of invites for users who invites the same user ,since there is no status check for invites

### Summary

In 'EthosProfile.sol' , when a user invites another user through the inviteAddress(), and if the invitee creates profile through another invite, since there are no way to check the status of the invites the valuable invites of users can be lost.

### Root Cause

```Solidity
  function inviteAddress(
    address invitee
  ) public whenNotPaused onlyNonZeroAddress(invitee) checkIfCompromised(invitee) {
    (bool verified, bool archived, bool mock, uint256 profileId) = profileStatusByAddress(
      msg.sender
    );

    if (!verified || archived || mock) {
      revert InvalidSender();
    }

    (bool recipientExists, , bool recipientMock, ) = profileStatusByAddress(invitee);

    if (recipientExists && !recipientMock) { //@audit redundant check    
      revert ProfileExists(profileId);
    }

    uint256 profile = profileIdByAddress[msg.sender];

    _profileShouldHaveInvites(profile);

    _isAddressAlreadyInvited(profile, invitee);

    sentInviteIndexByProfileIdAndAddress[profile][invitee] = profiles[profile]
      .inviteInfo
      .sent
      .length;
    profiles[profile].inviteInfo.sent.push(invitee);
    profiles[profile].inviteInfo.available--;
    sentAt[profile][invitee] = block.timestamp;
    emit UserInvited(profile, invitee);
  }
```

Consider a verified user sends around 100 invites and say 90 of them have created profiles through other invites, since there is no explicit method for the user to know the status of the invitee after the invites(whether they created profile through other invites) the user can lose track of the invites and lose valuable available invites. There should be a method to check the status of the invites that are already sent by a user and if the invitees have already created profiles through other invites, then those invites should be removed and the available invites should be aded back to the user balance.

### Impact

Loss of available invites for users and also loss of new users to the protocol.



### Mitigation

Implement a function to check the status of the invites by a user, it will travers through the `inviter.inviteInfo.sent` array and if the address has already profile created (which means user created through another invite) remove the invite from the array and add the inviter.inviteInfo.available balance back.
