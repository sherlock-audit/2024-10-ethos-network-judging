# There’s an error in the _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray function

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L591
In the _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray function, when an address is removed from the addresses array, the function should add the removed address to the removedAddresses array. However, the current implementation actually adds the last address to removedAddresses, which is incorrect.

### Root Cause

In  the deleteAddressAtIndex function, when an address is removed, it calls _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray:
```solidity
function deleteAddressAtIndex(uint256 addressIndex) external whenNotPaused {
    // ...some code omitted
    _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray(addressIndex, addresses, removedAddresses);
    // ...some code omitted
}
```
However, in the _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray function, the code is as follows:
```solidity
function _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray(
    uint256 index,
    address[] storage addresses,
    address[] storage removedAddresses
) private {
    address addr = addresses[addresses.length - 1];
    addresses[index] = addr;
    removedAddresses.push(addr);
    addresses.pop();
}
```
Here, addr is set to addresses[addresses.length - 1], which is the last address in the array. This address is then added to the removedAddresses array. However, we should actually be adding the address at the specified index, the address being deleted.

### Mitigation

Modify the _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray function to correctly add the removed address to the removedAddresses array. The modified code should be as follows:
```solidity
function _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray(
    uint256 index,
    address[] storage addresses,
    address[] storage removedAddresses
) private {
    address addr = addresses[index];
    removedAddresses.push(addr);
    addresses[index] = addresses[addresses.length - 1];
    addresses.pop();
}
```

address addr = addresses[index];: First, retrieve the address to be deleted.
removedAddresses.push(addr);: Add this address to the removedAddresses array.
addresses[index] = addresses[addresses.length - 1];: Replace the deleted element with the last element in the array to maintain continuity.
addresses.pop();: Remove the last element of the array.

With these modifications, the function will correctly handle address deletion, ensuring that the removed address is properly recorded, and the array’s state remains consistent.
