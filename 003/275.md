# Attacker will clog the protocol with arbitrary amount of profiles

### Summary

The `createProfile` method in EthosProfile allows a user to create a profile and have a default number of invitations in his profile.

The problem is that when he invites another address that is in his own control, he extends his invitation by 2* _invitationAmount_, this on repeat will have the attacker own a lot of profiles very quickly and manipulate things like reviews/votes and attestations.

### Root Cause

Any user upon invitation is allowed to have arbitrary amount of profiles if he uses the default invitations for himself.

```solidity
    profileIdByAddress[user] = profileId;
    profiles[profileId].profileId = profileId;
    profiles[profileId].createdAt = block.timestamp;
    profiles[profileId].inviteInfo.available = defaultNumberOfInvites;
    profiles[profileId].addresses.push(user);
```

For every new invitation he sends to another address controlled by him, he gains _defaultNumberOfInvites_ which allows him to get a large number of profiles quickly for spam and bot activites.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker gets invited 
2. Attacker uses his invitations to invite addresses controlled by him
3. Attacker repeats step 1 and 2 till he gets arbitrarily large amount of profiles

### Impact

The protocol is quickly overtaken by spam and its harmful effects on reviews, attestations and votes.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The mitigation is to make the process of creating profiles a bit costly. 

Either through time or money, such as new profiles needing 10 days before activation after an invite (this slows down the rapid creation of bot accounts) 

Or make it costly by making a fee when new profiles are created or sending invites.
