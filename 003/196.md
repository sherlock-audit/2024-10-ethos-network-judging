# Attestation Hash Collision


### Summary

The current attestation hashing mechanism may have hash collision issues.

### Root Cause

When hashing an attestation, it concatenates the service and account string. Currently, there is no specific format of service or account. For services, it can be any social media, e.g. Discord, Github, X, etc. For account, it can be anything.

Now, if we had two services that one is the prefix of another, there could be hash collision issues. Example:

1. Service = "X", Account = "iaohongshuAbc123"
2. Service = "Xiaohongshu", Account = "Abc123"

They would share the same attestation hash.

```solidity
  function getServiceAndAccountHash(
    string calldata service,
    string calldata account
  ) public pure returns (bytes32) {
    if (bytes(service).length == 0 || bytes(account).length == 0) {
      revert AttestationInvalid(service, account);
    }
    return keccak256(abi.encodePacked(service, account));
  }
```

### Impact

When users are creating/reviewing attestation, due to hash collision, only one of them can be created/reviewed.

### Mitigation

Process `keccak256` for both strings independently, then run a final `keccak256`. This way hash collision can be avoided.
