# Wrong delete implementation will push the wrong address to the array of removedAddresses

### Summary

The `EthosProfile::deleteAddressAtIndex()` function removes an address from a profileâ€™s active addresses and adds it to removedAddresses via `_deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray()`. However, the current implementation mistakenly pushes the last address in the addresses array to `removedAddresses` rather than the intended address that was deleted.

This bug causes a disconnect between the profile and the deleted address, as the actual deleted address ends up in neither Profile.addresses nor Profile.removedAddresses. Instead, an active address is pushed into `removedAddresses`, leading to an incorrect profile state.


### Root Cause

The function [`_deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L584-L593) overwrites the address at `addresses[index]` with the last address in the array (`addresses[addresses.length - 1]`). It then pushes this last address, rather than the intended deleted address, to `removedAddresses`:
```solidity
  function _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray(
    uint256 index,
    address[] storage addresses,
    address[] storage removedAddresses
  ) private {
@>  address addr = addresses[addresses.length - 1];
    addresses[index] = addr;
@>  removedAddresses.push(addr);
    addresses.pop();
  }
```

This causes:
- The actual removed address will not be tracked in `removedAddresses`
- The last address in the array will be on both `Profile.addresses` and `Profile.removedAddresses`


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

A user must trigger `deleteAddressAtIndex()` to remove an address from their `Profile.addresses`


### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The removed address is not properly stored in `removedAddresses`, leaving no record of it in the profile. The last added address is stored on both `addresses` and `removedAddresses`.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update `_deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray()` to push the actual deleted address to `removedAddresses`.
