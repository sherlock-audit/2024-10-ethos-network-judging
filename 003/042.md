# `_deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray()` pushes wrong address in removedAddresses array

### Summary

`_deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray()` pushes wrong address in `removedAddresses` array while deleting address at index using `EthosProfile:deleteAddressAtIndex()`

### Root Cause

In [EthosProfile:_deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L591), instead of pushing the address present at given index, it pushes the address present at last index
```solidity
  function _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray(
    uint256 index,
    address[] storage addresses,
    address[] storage removedAddresses
  ) private {
    address addr = addresses[addresses.length - 1];
    addresses[index] = addr;
@>  removedAddresses.push(addr);
    addresses.pop();
  }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Suppose user have 4 saved address at index [0,1,2,3] & user wanted to remove address at index = 1
2. User called deleteAddressAtIndex(), which removes the address present at 3rd index, instead of index = 1

### Impact

Wrong address will be removed from addresses array of User's profile & it will be pushed in removedAddress array

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
   function _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray(
        uint256 index,
        address[] storage addresses,
        address[] storage removedAddresses
    ) private {
        address addr = addresses[addresses.length - 1];
        addresses[index] = addr;
-       removedAddresses.push(addr);
+       removedAddresses.push(addresses[index]);
        addresses.pop();
    }
```
