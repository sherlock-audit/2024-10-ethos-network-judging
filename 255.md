# Preventing Inconsistent State in Contract Address Mapping: Fixing Bypass and Duplication Vulnerabilities

### Summary

The updateContractAddressesForNames function allows the contract owner to update mappings between names and contract addresses, with isEthosContract indicating which addresses are designated as "Ethos contracts." However, there is a vulnerability that can result in bypassing the update logic if the same address is reused, potentially causing inconsistent data and unexpected behavior in the contract.

### Root Cause

Bypassing Update with Reused Address: The function checks if an address is already mapped to a name by verifying if contractAddressForName[names[i]] is non-zero. However, it does not check if contractAddresses[i] matches current. This allows a scenario where an address already assigned to a name bypasses this check, preventing proper updates in isEthosContract.

Lack of Address Duplication Check in Input Arrays: No validation exists to prevent the same address from being listed multiple times in the contractAddresses array. This could lead to incorrect setting of isEthosContract, where only the last occurrence in the list will remain flagged as true.

### Attack Path

Data Inconsistency through Duplicate Addresses: By reusing an address in the contractAddresses array, an attacker could manipulate the isEthosContract mapping, potentially unflagging addresses that should remain flagged.

Invalid Updates Due to Bypass Condition: When an address is already associated with a name, the function skips the flag update (isEthosContract[current] = false). This creates a pathway for a malicious actor to intentionally prevent certain addresses from being unflagged, leading to incorrect entries in isEthosContract.

### Impact

### Mitigation

Duplicate Check with addressExists: By using a local mapping to track addresses, the function now reverts if any address is duplicated in contractAddresses.

Improved Bypass Prevention: The conditional now includes a check for contractAddresses[i] equality with current, ensuring that the isEthosContract mapping is updated accurately even when an address already exists.

Event Emission: The event is emitted after each successful update, providing visibility and traceability for each mapping change.
