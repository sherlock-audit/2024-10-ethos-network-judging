# `uninviteUser(...)` function is not pausable

### Summary

The absence of the `whenNotPaused` modifier in the `uninviteUser(...)` function allows it to be called even when the contract is paused.

### Root Cause

The `uninviteUser(...)` function at [EthosProfile.sol#L258](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L258) lacks the `whenNotPaused` modifier, which would prevent its execution during a protocol pause.

### Impact

With the protocol paused, `uninviteUser(...)` can still be invoked, potentially causing contract state inconsistencies. For example, while users are restricted from registering new profiles during a pause, an inviter could still revoke their invitation, blocking the user from future registration even after the pause is lifted. 

The missing pausable functionality disallow the admin of the protocol the paused whole protocol, however the pausing functionality based on the context of other contracts should pause all state changing function. In this case the invariant is broken.

*Note: The protocol team confirmed that this behaviour is unintended.*

### Mitigation

Add the `whenNotPaused` modifier to the `uninviteUser(...)` function to ensure it cannot be called while the protocol is paused.
