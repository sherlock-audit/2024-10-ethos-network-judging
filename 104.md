# Reply can be done to a non Ethos Target Contract in EthosDiscussion

### Summary

Missing validation of target contracts in EthosDiscussion will allow linking of unauthorized contracts as reply targets as malicious actors can pass any contract address that implements ITargetStatus interface.

### Root Cause

In EthosDiscussion.sol the _checkIfTargetExistsAndAllowed function (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosDiscussion.sol#L300) lacks validation to ensure that targetContract is a registered Ethos contract. It only verifies the target ID exists in the provided contract without validating the contract itself.

```solidity
  function _checkIfTargetExistsAndAllowed(address targetContract, uint256 targetId) private view {
    (bool exists, ) = ITargetStatus(targetContract).targetExistsAndAllowedForId(targetId);


    if (!exists) {
      revert TargetNotFound(targetContract, targetId);
    }
  }
}
```

The documentation specifically mentions that the reply  should only target valid Ethos contracts but the implementation fails to validate it:

> `targetContract` MUST be a current Ethos network smart contract



### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker deploys a malicious contract implementing ITargetStatus interface that always returns true for targetExistsAndAllowedForId

```solidity
contract FakeTarget is ITargetStatus {
    function targetExistsAndAllowedForId(uint256) external pure returns (bool, bool) {
        return (true, true);
    }
    // Potential malicious logic
}
```

2. Attacker calls addReply with the fake contract address as targetContract

```solidity
discussion.addReply(address(fakeTarget), 1, "content", "metadata");
```

The reply is successfully created and linked to an unauthorized contract since _checkIfTargetExistsAndAllowed only verifies the target ID exists

### Impact

The protocol's data integrity is compromised as replies can be linked to unauthorized contracts. This could lead to:

1. Storage of invalid reply references to unauthorized contracts
2. Breaking of core assumption that all interactions should be for valid Ethos contracts
3. Each vote or reply to these compromised replies will indirectly reference the unauthorized contract, compounding the number of protocol actions tied to invalid contracts
