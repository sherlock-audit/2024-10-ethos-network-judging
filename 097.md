# Profile's max addresses cannot work as expected if we repeat register, unregister one address in one profile

### Summary

In EthosProfile::registerAddress, we miss updating `profiles[profileId].removedAddresses`. This will cause `maxNumberOfAddresses` limitation cannot work well.

### Root Cause

In [EthosProfile:373](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L403-L404), users can register one address into one active profile. 
There are two basic scenario for registerAddress():
1. Register one fresh address into one profile
2. Register one deleted address back to our profile. `Use case: user can register, unregister and register again the same address.`
The problem is that when we try to register one deleted address back to our profile, we miss delete this address from `profiles[profileId].removedAddresses`. This will cause this registered address will be in `profiles[profileId].addresses` and `profiles[profileId].removedAddresses` at the same time. This will cause the number of this profile's addresses cannot reach `maxNumberOfAddresses`.

```solidity
  function registerAddress(
    address addressStr,
    uint256 profileId,
    uint256 randValue,
    bytes calldata signature
  ) external whenNotPaused onlyNonZeroAddress(addressStr) {
    ...
    profiles[profileId].addresses.push(addressStr);
    profileIdByAddress[addressStr] = profileId;
    checkMaxAddresses(profileId);
  }
  function checkMaxAddresses(uint256 profileId) internal view {
    uint256 sum = profiles[profileId].addresses.length;
    sum += profiles[profileId].removedAddresses.length;
    if (sum > maxNumberOfAddresses) {
      revert MaxAddressesReached(profileId);
    }
  }
```


### Internal pre-conditions

1. One address is deleted and re-registered by the profile owner.

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. One address is deleted and re-registered into the profile.
2. When the user wants to register his last address in `maxNumberOfAddresses`, the register will be reverted.

### Impact

Users' maximum address may be lower than `maxNumberOfAddresses`. This is unexpected behaviour, and break the design intent.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

When we register one address, if this address exists in the `profiles[profileId].removedAddresses` list, we should remove this address from the `profiles[profileId].removedAddresses`.
