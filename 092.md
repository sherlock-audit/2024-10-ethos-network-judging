# Users will not be able to archive or restore all the reviews made by their profile.

## Summary

When archiving or restoring a review, `review.author` is verified to be equal to `msg.sender`. This means that only the author of the review can archive or restore it, even if `msg.sender` is associated with the same profile.

Therefore, if the author of the review is compromised and the user has to delete this address from the profile, he will not be able to archive or restore reviews made by that address.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `EthosReview::archiveReview()` and `EthosProfile::restoreReview()` functions, it is verified that `msg.sender` is equal to `review.author`.

```solidity
  function archiveReview(uint256 reviewId) external whenNotPaused {
    ... ...
    if (review.author != msg.sender) {
      revert UnauthorizedArchiving(reviewId);
    }
    ... ...
  }
```

```solidity
  function restoreReview(uint256 reviewId) external whenNotPaused {
    ... ...
    if (review.author != msg.sender) {
      revert UnauthorizedArchiving(reviewId);
    }
    ... ...
  }
```

The `review.author` is the address of the `msg.sender` that called `EthosReview::addReview()` to add the review.
This means that only the address that added the review will be able to archive or restore it.
If an address is compromised and deleted, any reviews made by that address can not be archived or restored, as no deleted address should be able to take any action on behalf of the profile.

Furthermore, this is inconsistent with the rest of the protocol, as any address associated with the same profile can edit votes, replies and reviews made by that profile. The same goes for archiving and restoring attestations.

## Attack Path

Consider the following scenario:

ProfileA consists of AddressB and AddressC.

1. AddressB calls `addReview()` to add ReviewX and ReviewY.
2. AddressB is compromised.
3. AddressC calls `EthosProfile::deleteAddressAtIndex()` to delete the compromised address.
4. In the future, AddressC wants to archive a review made by AddressB and calls `EthosReview::archiveReview()`.
5. The call reverts and will continue to do so whenever it is called by a different address than AddressB.

## Impact

If an address associated with a profile is compromised, the reviews made by that address can not be archived or restored.
Furthermore, if a user decides that only one of his addresses should add reviews, he will not be able to archive or restore any review made by his profile until that point.
The only way for this to change is when the user gets the address back that added the reviews.

## Recommendation

Consider allowing any address associated with the same profile to archive and restore reviews made by that profile.
