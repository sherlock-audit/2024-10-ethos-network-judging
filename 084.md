# Self-reviews on attestations can be performed

### Summary

When reviews are added it is made sure that the profile of the caller is not the same as the profile of the subject/attestation. However, in the case of attestations, this validation can be bypassed.

### Root Cause

In the `_validateReviewDetails` it is made sure that self-reviews are [not possible](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosReview.sol#L534). However, in the case of attestations, a user will be able to create a review for an existing attestation right before they claim it, through the `createAttestation` function. This will allow them to bypass the validation, creating self-reviews.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A user is about to claim an existing attestation for their profile.
2. Right before they claim it they create multiple positive reviews on that attestation.
3. They claim the attestation that has multiple unfair reviews.

### Impact

Users can self-review, which should not be allowed by the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The fix is non-trivial.
