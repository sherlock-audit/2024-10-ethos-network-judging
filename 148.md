# A user may not be able to register addresses to their profile due to improper handling of `removedAddresses`

## Summary

It is intended that when a user registers a new address to their profile, the function call reverts if there are too many addresses associated with the profile. However, the function call may also revert if addresses associated with the profile are deleted and restored too frequently.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `EthosProfile::deleteAddressAtIndex()` function, there is a call to `_deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray()` to delete an address from the array that holds the active addresses and `push()` it onto the `removedAddresses` array.
This should ensure that removed addresses remain associated with the profile.

Deleted addresses can then be restored if an address associated with the same profile calls `EthosProfile::registerAddress()`.
Inside this function, there is a call to `checkMaxAddresses()` to ensure that the profile cannot be associated with more addresses than `maxNumberOfAddresses`, which can be set by the admin to a maximum of `2048`.

In detail, this function adds the number of active addresses associated with the profile to the number of `removedAddresses` associated with the profile, ensuring that the sum does not exceed `maxNumberOfAddresses`.

```solidity
  function checkMaxAddresses(uint256 profileId) internal view {
    uint256 sum = profiles[profileId].addresses.length;
    sum += profiles[profileId].removedAddresses.length;
    if (sum > maxNumberOfAddresses) {
      revert MaxAddressesReached(profileId);
    }
  }
```

However, when an address is restored, it is not deleted from `removedAddresses`. This means that if that restored address is compromised and deleted again, it will be stored twice.

This could occur an unlimited amount of times with multiple addresses until the user can no longer register or restore any address to the profile.
It is important to note that this issue arises if a user uses the protocol as intended.

### Attack Path

Consider the following scenario with `maxNumberOfAddresses = 5`:

1. AddressA calls `EthosProfile::registerAddress()` to register AddressB.
2. AddressA calls `EthosProfile::registerAddress()` to register AddressC.

`profiles[profileId].addresses` contains AddressA, AddressB and AddressC.
`sum = 3`

3. AddressC is compromised.
4. AddressA calls `EthosProfile::deleteAddressAtIndex()` to delete AddressC.

`profiles[profileId].addresses` contains AddressA and AddressB.
`profiles[profileId].removedAddresses` contains AddressC.
`sum = 3`

5. AddressA calls `EthosProfile::registerAddress()` to restore AddressC after it is no longer compromised.

`profiles[profileId].addresses` contains AddressA, AddressB and AddressC.
`profiles[profileId].removedAddresses` contains AddressC.
`sum = 4`

6. AddressC is compromised again.
7. AddressA calls `EthosProfile::deleteAddressAtIndex()` to delete AddressC.
8. AddressA calls `EthosProfile::registerAddress()` to restore AddressC after it is no longer compromised.

`profiles[profileId].addresses` contains AddressA, AddressB and AddressC.
`profiles[profileId].removedAddresses` contains AddressC twice.
`sum = 5`

9. AddressA calls `EthosProfile::registerAddress()` to register AddressD, but the call reverts.

This happens because the profile contains three different active addresses (AddressA, AddressB and AddressC), but the `removedAddresses` array contains AddressC twice, even though it is an active address. Registering a new address would mean that `sum = 6`. This causes the user to be unable to register new addresses to the profile.

### PoC

The following test tests the above scenario and should be added in `EthosProfile.test.ts`:

```javascript
    it('should succeed if address deleted multiple times', async () => {
      const { ethosProfile, PROFILE_CREATOR_0, EXPECTED_SIGNER, OTHER_0, OWNER, ADMIN, OTHER_1, PROFILE_CREATOR_1 } =
        await loadFixture(deployFixture);

      await ethosProfile.connect(ADMIN).setMaxAddresses(5);

      const profileId = String(2);
      const rand = '123';
      const signature = await common.signatureForRegisterAddress(
        OTHER_0.address,
        profileId,
        rand,
        EXPECTED_SIGNER,
      );

      await ethosProfile.connect(OWNER).inviteAddress(PROFILE_CREATOR_0.address);
      await ethosProfile.connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0).createProfile(1);
      await ethosProfile
        .connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0)
        .registerAddress(OTHER_0.address, profileId, rand, signature);

      let addresses = await ethosProfile.addressesForProfile(2);
      expect(addresses.length).to.be.equal(2, 'should be 2 addresses');
      expect(addresses[0]).to.be.equal(PROFILE_CREATOR_0.address, 'wrong address[0]');
      expect(addresses[1]).to.be.equal(OTHER_0.address, 'wrong address[1]');

      const profileId2 = String(2);
      const rand2 = '1234';
      const signature2 = await common.signatureForRegisterAddress(
        OTHER_1.address,
        profileId2,
        rand2,
        EXPECTED_SIGNER,
      );

      await ethosProfile
        .connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0)
        .registerAddress(OTHER_1.address, profileId2, rand2, signature2);

      addresses = await ethosProfile.addressesForProfile(2);
      expect(addresses.length).to.be.equal(3, 'should be 3 addresses');
      expect(addresses[0]).to.be.equal(PROFILE_CREATOR_0.address, 'wrong address[0]');
      expect(addresses[1]).to.be.equal(OTHER_0.address, 'wrong address[1]');
      expect(addresses[2]).to.be.equal(OTHER_1.address, 'wrong address[2]');
       
      await ethosProfile.connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0).deleteAddressAtIndex(2);
  
      addresses = await ethosProfile.addressesForProfile(2);
      expect(addresses.length).to.be.equal(2, 'should be 2 addresses');
      expect(addresses[0]).to.be.equal(PROFILE_CREATOR_0.address, 'wrong address[0]');
      expect(addresses[1]).to.be.equal(OTHER_0.address, 'wrong address[1]');
      
      const profileId3 = String(2);
      const rand3 = '12345';
      const signature3 = await common.signatureForRegisterAddress(
        OTHER_1.address,
        profileId3,
        rand3,
        EXPECTED_SIGNER,
      );

      await ethosProfile.connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0)
      .registerAddress(OTHER_1.address, profileId3, rand3, signature3);

      addresses = await ethosProfile.addressesForProfile(2);
      expect(addresses.length).to.be.equal(3, 'should be 3 addresses');
      expect(addresses[0]).to.be.equal(PROFILE_CREATOR_0.address, 'wrong address[0]');
      expect(addresses[1]).to.be.equal(OTHER_0.address, 'wrong address[1]');
      expect(addresses[2]).to.be.equal(OTHER_1.address, 'wrong address[2]');
      
      await ethosProfile.connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0).deleteAddressAtIndex(2);
  
      addresses = await ethosProfile.addressesForProfile(2);
      expect(addresses.length).to.be.equal(2, 'should be 2 addresses');
      expect(addresses[0]).to.be.equal(PROFILE_CREATOR_0.address, 'wrong address[0]');
      expect(addresses[1]).to.be.equal(OTHER_0.address, 'wrong address[1]');

      const profileId4 = String(2);
      const rand4 = '123456';
      const signature4 = await common.signatureForRegisterAddress(
        OTHER_1.address,
        profileId4,
        rand4,
        EXPECTED_SIGNER,
      );

      await ethosProfile.connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0)
      .registerAddress(OTHER_1.address, profileId4, rand4, signature4);

      addresses = await ethosProfile.addressesForProfile(2);
      expect(addresses.length).to.be.equal(3, 'should be 3 addresses');
      expect(addresses[0]).to.be.equal(PROFILE_CREATOR_0.address, 'wrong address[0]');
      expect(addresses[1]).to.be.equal(OTHER_0.address, 'wrong address[1]');
      expect(addresses[2]).to.be.equal(OTHER_1.address, 'wrong address[2]');

      
      const profileId5 = String(2);
      const rand5 = '1234567';
      const signature5 = await common.signatureForRegisterAddress(
        PROFILE_CREATOR_1.address,
        profileId5,
        rand5,
        EXPECTED_SIGNER,
      );
      
      await expect(ethosProfile.connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0)
      .registerAddress(PROFILE_CREATOR_1.address, profileId5, rand5, signature5))
      .to.be.revertedWithCustomError(ethosProfile, 'MaxAddressesReached')
      .withArgs(2);
    });
```

### Impact

Users will not be able to register more addresses to their profile, as the `removedAddresses` array becomes filled with multiple addresses that have been deleted and restored repeatedly after being compromised again. Even if the admin increases the `maxNumberOfAddresses`, he will not be able to set it higher than `2048`.

In the worst-case that number could be filled with only one address, even if the user uses the protocol as intended.
This means that there is be no protection if that address is compromised, as no one would be able to delete it.

### Recommendation

Consider deleting addresses in `removedAddresses` when they get restored.
