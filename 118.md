# Profile Address Array Manipulation Vulnerability

### Summary

**Incorrect array manipulation in `deleteAddressAtIndex` will cause data corruption for profile addresses as attacker can exploit the array reordering to maintain control over supposedly deleted addresses**

### Root Cause

In `EthosProfile.sol:_deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray` the function incorrectly handles array manipulation by storing the last address in removedAddresses instead of the deleted address

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Profile must have multiple registered addresses
2. One of the addresses needs to be compromised

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

**1. Attacker calls deleteAddressAtIndex for a compromised address
2. The function moves the last valid address to removedAddresses instead of the compromised one
3. The compromised address remains in the active addresses array at a different index**

### Impact

**The profile owner suffers from incorrect address management, potentially losing control of valid addresses while compromised addresses remain active.**

### PoC

Reference Line code : https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L584

Modify this function at the same place
```solidity
function _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray(
    uint256 index,
    address[] storage addresses,
    address[] storage removedAddresses
) private {
    address addressToRemove = addresses[index];
    addresses[index] = addresses[addresses.length - 1];
    removedAddresses.push(addressToRemove);
    addresses.pop();
}
```

### Mitigation

Modify the `_deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray` function to store the actually deleted address in removedAddresses instead of the last address:
```solidity
function _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray(
    uint256 index,
    address[] storage addresses,
    address[] storage removedAddresses
) private {
    address addressToRemove = addresses[index];
    addresses[index] = addresses[addresses.length - 1];
    removedAddresses.push(addressToRemove);
    addresses.pop();
}
```
