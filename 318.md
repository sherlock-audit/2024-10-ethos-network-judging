# Review authors should be able to archive and restore reviews from any address that belongs to the profile

### Summary

In EthosReview.sol authors of reviews can archive and restore reviews only from the original address, even though the profile can have multiple address registered to it.
```solidity
function archiveReview(uint256 reviewId) external whenNotPaused {
    (bool exists, ) = targetExistsAndAllowedForId(reviewId);

    if (!exists) {
      revert ReviewNotFound(reviewId);
    }

    Review storage review = reviews[reviewId];

    if (review.archived) {
      revert ReviewIsArchived(reviewId);
    }

    if (review.author != msg.sender) {
      revert UnauthorizedArchiving(reviewId);
    }

    review.archived = true;

    emit ReviewArchived(reviewId, msg.sender, review.subject);
  }

  function restoreReview(uint256 reviewId) external whenNotPaused {
    _getEthosProfile().verifiedProfileIdForAddress(msg.sender);
    Review storage review = reviews[reviewId];

    if (review.author == address(0)) {
      revert ReviewNotFound(reviewId);
    }

    if (review.author != msg.sender) {
      revert UnauthorizedArchiving(reviewId);
    }

    if (!review.archived) {
      revert ReviewNotArchived(reviewId);
    }

    review.archived = false;

    emit ReviewRestored(reviewId, msg.sender, review.subject);
  }
```
