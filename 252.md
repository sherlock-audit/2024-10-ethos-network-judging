# Claiming attestation or address of mock profile to an existing profile will remove the reviews, votes and discussions associated with it

### Summary

When a user creates a review for a subject (address) or attestation that does not have a profile, it will create a mock profile, with which will be associated all votes, reviews, and discussions. However when an existing user registers the address, or claims the attestation, the profile ID associated with the address, or the attestation will be changed from the mock one to the user's one. But the reviews, votes and discussions created for this mock profile will be lost.

### Root Cause

In [registerAddress()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L373) the profile ID value is changed if the address does not have a profile or if the profile is mock. But the treatment of the two cases is the same, which is not correct, because a change in the mappings in reviews, discussions and votes is required.

In [_claimAttestation()]() only the attestation is removed from the mock profile ID and added to the the existing profile.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A review is created to a non existing address so that mock profile is created.
2. A review is created to an attestation

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A user registers the address to his profile
2. This operation will wipe out all votes, reviews and discussions for that address.

### Impact

The address will lose all votes, reviews and discussions. They will not be deleted, but will be associated with a profile ID that doesn't have the address anymore.

### Mitigation

The mitigation is not straightforward, because it will require changes in multiple contracts.
