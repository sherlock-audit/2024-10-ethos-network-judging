# `EthosProfile::uninviteUser` can be potentially called during paused state

### Summary

The missing `whenNotPaused` modifier check on the [`EthosProfile::uninviteUser`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L258) allows users to uinvite users during pause state.

### Root Cause

The [`EthosProfile::uninviteUser`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L258)  lacks `whenNotPaused` modifier check.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to pause the state of `EthosProfile` contract

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A user would call [`EthosProfile::uninviteUser`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L258)  function even during a paused state of `EthosProfile`

### Impact

The protocol would suffer with unintended state changes such as changes in the `profiles` mapping, `sentAt` storage being updated and event emission.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider addition of `whenNotPaused` to the `uninviteUser` function
