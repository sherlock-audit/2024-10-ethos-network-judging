# Incorrect handling of payments Making it impossible to pay Review Price

### Summary

When transferring the paymentToken amount paid for a review the amount is transferred using `IERC20(paymentToken).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), price);`. This will fail because `transferFrom` requires the user to have sufficient `allowance` for ``msg.sender``'s tokens of at least `price`. 
However since an approval has not been made it will lead to a situation where allowance will be zero, and the `transferFrom` call will revert.

### Root Cause

Use of `transferFrom` function wrongly

### Internal pre-conditions

Price of a review should be more than 0


### External pre-conditions


User paying for a review using an approved paymentToken


### Attack Path

1. Admin sets review price to 2USDT where USDT is the payment token.
2. Bob a user who has an `EthosProfile` wants to add a review to Alices' user address(subject) 
3. The `_handlePayment` internal function will be called with the address of the PaymentToken..
4. On Bob paying the 2USDT the transaction will revert because he has not approved the contract to spend `price` on his behalf.
This is because the `transferFrom` function of the ERC20.sol imported from Openzeppelin contracts has a spend allowance function call to check the allowance before doing a transfer.

```javascript
/* Requirements:
     *
     * - `from` and `to` cannot be the zero address.
     * - `from` must have a balance of at least `value`.
     * - the caller must have allowance for ``from``'s tokens of at least
     * `value`.
     */
       function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 value) public virtual returns (bool) {
        address spender = _msgSender();
        _spendAllowance(from, spender, value);
        _transfer(from, to, value);
        return true;
    }

```
The call will revert when an allowance approval has not been made and with this bug the protocol won't be able to receive the review fees amount

### Impact

- Users/Reviewers will not be able to leave reviews on subjects or attestations when `price >0`
- Protocol won't be able to receive review amount

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Replace `transferFrom` with [safeTransfer](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/448efeea6640bbbc09373f03fbc9c88e280147ba/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol#L33-L35) from safeERC20 (openzeppelin) which does not require additional approval

```diff
 function _handlePayment(address paymentToken) private onlyValidPaymentToken(paymentToken) {
    uint256 price = reviewPrice[paymentToken].price;

    if (price > 0) {
        if (paymentToken == address(0)) {
           if (msg.value != price) {
            revert WrongPaymentAmount(paymentToken, msg.value);
         }
      } else {
        if (msg.value > 0) {

          revert WrongPaymentAmount(address(0), msg.value);
        }

--      IERC20(paymentToken).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), price);
++      IERC20(paymentToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, address(this), price);


      }
    }
  }
