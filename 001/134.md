# Unauthorized Attestation Creation/Claiming via Front-Running

### Summary

The lack of **nonce** or **signature tracking** will cause **unauthorized attestation creation** or **claiming** for users, as an attacker can **front-run** their transactions using the same valid signature.

### Root Cause

The choice to not implement **nonce** or **signature tracking** is a mistake, as it allows signatures to be reused, enabling **front-running attacks**.
in the function `createAttestation`  
```solidity
function createAttestation(
    uint256 profileId,
    uint256 randValue,
    AttestationDetails calldata attestationDetails,
    string calldata evidence,
    bytes calldata signature
  ) external whenNotPaused 
{
    validateAndSaveSignature(
      _keccakForCreateAttestation(
        profileId,
        randValue,
        attestationDetails.account,
        attestationDetails.service,
        evidence
      ),
      signature
    );
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The user submits a transaction with a **valid signature** to create or claim an attestation.
2. The signature is not marked as **used** until the transaction is processed.


### External pre-conditions

1. The attacker monitors the **mempool** for transactions with valid signatures.
2. The network allows transactions to be **reordered** based on **gas price**.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker observes a transaction with a valid signature in the **mempool**.
2. The attacker submits their own transaction using the same signature with a **higher gas price**.
3. The attacker's transaction is processed first, creating or claiming the attestation.


### Impact

The user cannot associate their **online account** with their **profile**, disrupting their **identity verification process**. The attacker gains control over the attestation.

### Mitigation

Nonce System:

Introduce a nonce for each user or transaction. This nonce should be included in the data that is signed and verified by the contract. Ensure that each nonce is unique and can only be used once.
