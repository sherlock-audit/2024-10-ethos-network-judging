### Summary

By waiting to claim their attestations, users can first review their own profiles before claiming these attestation.

In `ethosReview.sol`, profiles are not supposed to review their own profiles, but before claiming the attestation, a user can first provide a review to his own profileId since a mock id will be created for that  review and anytime he can claim his attestation hash and it will be assigned to him.

### Internal pre-conditions

Attestation not yet claimed by the user or registered in the attestation contract.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Profile user creates a review using attestation details instead of subject address.
2. The attestation details get a mock id and provide review to the profile.
