# mocked,archived profiles could archive attestations

### Summary

In archiveAttestation() msg.sender is only being checked if it is a part of profileId, which could result of mocked,archived profile being able to do operations that he is not supposed to.



### Root Cause

msg.sender and profileId should be checked if they are verified profile or mocked user. Whenever this is not done there is a chance of compromise within the system.
