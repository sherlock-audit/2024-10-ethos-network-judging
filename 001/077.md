# Users can cause incorrect tracking of compromised addresses

### Summary

Incorrect address removal logic in the [_deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L584-L593) will cause incorrect tracking of compromised addresses for the protocol, as users deleting an address will incorrectly record the wrong address as removed.

### Root Cause

In the `EthosProfile.sol` contract, the `_deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray` function incorrectly pushes the last address to the `removedAddresses` array instead of the address being removed. This results in compromised addresses not being properly tracked.

```solidity
function _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray(
    uint256 index,
    address[] storage addresses,
    address[] storage removedAddresses
) private {
    address addr = addresses[addresses.length - 1];  // Gets last address
    addresses[index] = addr;                         // Moves it to deleted position
    removedAddresses.push(addr);                     // Incorrectly pushes last address
    addresses.pop();                                 // Removes last element
}
```

### Attack Path

1. User calls `deleteAddressAtIndex(uint256 addressIndex)` to delete an address at `addressIndex` from their profile.
2. Inside `deleteAddressAtIndex`, the function `_deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray(addressIndex, addresses, removedAddresses)` is called.
3. The `_deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray` function incorrectly pushes the last address in the `addresses` array to `removedAddresses` instead of the address being deleted.
4. The actual address being deleted (potentially compromised) is not recorded in `removedAddresses`.
5. As a result, compromised addresses are not properly tracked, undermining security mechanisms that rely on accurate address tracking.

### Impact

The protocol cannot correctly track compromised addresses, leading to potential security vulnerabilities. Compromised addresses may not be properly marked and could be reused or re-registered, exposing the protocol and users to possible loss of funds or unauthorized actions.

### PoC

Assume a user has a profile with the following addresses:

```solidity
addresses = [addr1, addr2, addr3];
removedAddresses = [];

```

The user wants to delete `addr1`, which is at index `0`.

1. User calls `deleteAddressAtIndex(0)`.
2. Inside `deleteAddressAtIndex`, the following code is executed:
    
    ```solidity
    address addressStr = addresses[addressIndex]; // addressStr = addr1
    isAddressCompromised[addressStr] = true;
    _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray(addressIndex, addresses, removedAddresses);
    emit AddressClaim(profileId, addressStr, AddressClaimStatus.Unclaimed);
    
    ```
    
3. Inside `_deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray`, the code executes as:
    
    ```solidity
    function _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray(
        uint256 index,
        address[] storage addresses,
        address[] storage removedAddresses
    ) private {
        address addr = addresses[addresses.length - 1]; // addr = addr3
        addresses[index] = addr;                        // addresses[0] = addr3
        removedAddresses.push(addr);                    // removedAddresses.push(addr3)
        addresses.pop();                                // addresses = [addr3, addr2]
    }
    
    ```
    
4. After execution:
    - `addresses` becomes `[addr3, addr2]`
    - `removedAddresses` becomes `[addr3]`
5. Result:
    - The intended address to remove, `addr1`, is not recorded in `removedAddresses`.
    - `addr3` (which is still associated with the profile) is incorrectly marked as removed.
    - Compromised address tracking is broken.

### Mitigation

Modify the `_deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray` function to correctly record the address being removed:
