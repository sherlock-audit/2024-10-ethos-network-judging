# Incorrect authentication will cause reviews to remain permanently archived

### Summary

In Ethos, each user has their own profile, identified by a unique id, which can have multiple addresses. Throughout the system, authentication is handled using `profile.profileId` or signatures.

Ethos allows profiles to leave reviews for other profiles or attestations. Users also have the ability to temporarily archive reviews and restore them at any time. **This is where the issue arises**.

Each review has `authorProfileId` and `author` fields. System-wide authentication is handled using `profile.profileId` and is applied correctly in the `editReview()` function:

```solidity
261: function editReview(uint256 reviewId, string calldata comment, string calldata metadata) external whenNotPaused {
        Review storage review = reviews[reviewId];
        uint256 authorProfileId = _getEthosProfile().verifiedProfileIdForAddress(msg.sender);

  ðŸ“Œ    if (review.authorProfileId != authorProfileId) {
            revert UnauthorizedEdit(reviewId);
        }

    }
```

[_EthosReview.sol#269_](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosReview.sol#L269)

However, in the `archiveReview()` and `restoreReview()` functions, there is an inconsistency, as they check against `msg.sender` **instead of** `profile.profileId`:

### Root Cause

Using `msg.sender` instead of `profile.profileId` for authorization in `archiveReview()` & `restoreReview()` functions:

```solidity
287:  function archiveReview(uint256 reviewId) external whenNotPaused {
        ...
        Review storage review = reviews[reviewId];

        if (review.archived) {
            revert ReviewIsArchived(reviewId);
        }

  ðŸ“Œ    if (review.author != msg.sender) {
            revert UnauthorizedArchiving(reviewId);
        }
        ...
    }

```

[_EthosReview.sol#321_](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosReview.sol#L321)

### Internal pre-conditions

A profile needs to have least two addresses registered.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

UserA a profile with two addresses registered: **(0x123, 0x456)**

1. UserA writes a review about UserB.
2. UserA archives the review.
3. UserA **loses access to address 0x123**. (compromised, lost, etc.)
4. UserA still has access to address **0x456**
5. UserA **attempts** to restore the review, but the **function reverts** because it checks against `msg.sender` instead of `profile.profileId`.

### Impact

The review will remain **permanently** archived. The user will not be able to restore it or, conversely, may not be able to archive the review.

This also creates inconsistency within the system, as the user can use any address to use the Ethos system, yet the reviews remain tied to the original address rather than the profile.

### PoC

Place the following code in `address.compromised.test.ts`:

```typescript
// eslint-disable-next-line jest/no-focused-tests
it.only('should leave a review archived forever', async () => {
  const userA2 = await deployer.newWallet();
  const userA2Signature = await common.signatureForRegisterAddress(
    userA2.address,
    defaultProfileId.toString(),
    defaultEvidence.toString(),
    EXPECTED_SIGNER,
  );

  // UserA registers his second address
  await ethosProfile
    .connect(userA.signer)
    .registerAddress(userA2, defaultProfileId, defaultEvidence, userA2Signature);

  const ethosReview = deployer.ethosReview.contract;

  // UserA leaves a review for UserB from his first address
  await ethosReview
    .connect(userA2)
    .addReview(
      REVIEW_PARAMS.score,
      userB.signer.address,
      DEFAULT.PAYMENT_TOKEN,
      REVIEW_PARAMS.comment,
      REVIEW_PARAMS.metadata,
      REVIEW_PARAMS.attestationDetails,
    );

  const reviews = await ethosReview.reviewsByAuthorInRange(userA.profileId, 0, 10);

  expect(reviews.length).to.equal(1);
  expect(reviews[0].author).to.equal(userA2.address);

  await ethosReview.connect(userA2).archiveReview(reviews[0].reviewId);

  await ethosProfile.connect(userA.signer).deleteAddressAtIndex(1);

  // user tries to restore his review from the same profile but different address that's not compromised.
  await expect(
    ethosReview.connect(userA.signer).restoreReview(reviews[0].reviewId),
  ).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(ethosReview, 'UnauthorizedArchiving');
  // gets reverted due to not using profileId for authorization
});
```

</details>

### Mitigation

Replace

```solidity
if (review.author != msg.sender) {
```

with

```solidity
if (review.authorProfileId != authorProfileId) {
```
in both `archiveReview()` and `restoreReview()` functions to resolve the inconsistency.

Also a check for compromised addresses should be added to prevent other issues.
