# Users can't add max number of addresses to their profile.

### Summary

When an address is deleted from a profile, it is pushed to the `removedAddresses` array.
However, when the same address is registered again to the profile, it is not popped out from the `removeAddresses` array.
As a result, the number of addresses tied to the profile becomes inflated, preventing the user from adding max number of addresses allowed to his own profile.

### Root Cause

When an address is deleted, it is popped out from `addresses` array and pushed into the `removeAddresses` array, using the following `EthosProfile.checkMaxAddresses()` function.
```solidity
  function _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray(
    uint256 index,
    address[] storage addresses,
    address[] storage removedAddresses
  ) private {
    address addr = addresses[addresses.length - 1];
    addresses[index] = addr;
    removedAddresses.push(addr);
    addresses.pop();
  }
```
When the deleted address is registered again to the profile, it is pushed back into the `addresses` but not popped out from the `removeAddresses`, in the following `EthosProfile.registerAddress()` function.
```solidity
  function registerAddress(
    address addressStr,
    uint256 profileId,
    uint256 randValue,
    bytes calldata signature
  ) external whenNotPaused onlyNonZeroAddress(addressStr) {
    ...SKIP...

    profiles[profileId].addresses.push(addressStr);
    profileIdByAddress[addressStr] = profileId;

    checkMaxAddresses(profileId);

    emit AddressClaim(profileId, addressStr, AddressClaimStatus.Claimed);
  }
```
As a result, the same address exists in the `addresses` and `removeAddresses` arrays. This causes the total number of addresses tied to the profile to be inflated, and the user is unable to add max number of addresses allowed to his own profile due to the following `EthosProfile.checkMaxAddresses()` function.
```solidity
  function checkMaxAddresses(uint256 profileId) internal view {
    uint256 sum = profiles[profileId].addresses.length;
    sum += profiles[profileId].removedAddresses.length;
    if (sum > maxNumberOfAddresses) {
      revert MaxAddressesReached(profileId);
    }
  }
```

### Attack Path

1. Assume that `maxNumberOfAddresses = 10` and a user has added `10` addresses to his own profile.
2. The user delete address `addr1` from his profile. `addr1` is popped from `addresses` and pushed into `removeAddresses`. Now, `addresses.length = 9` and `removeAddresses.length = 1`.
3. The user register `addr1` again to his own profile. `addr1` is pushed back into `addresses` but not popped out from `removeAddresses`. 
4. With 10 addresses in `addresses` and 1 address in `removeAddresses`, the registration reverts in the `checkMaxAddresses()` function because the combined total sum exceeds the maximum allowed.

### Impact

Breaks core contract functionality because users are unable to register maximum number of addresses to their profile.

### PoC

Assume that user added addr1 to addr10 and removed addr1 to addr5.
In this case, user can't add addr11 but user can't add addr1 back as well.
But he should be able to add removed addresses back.

### Mitigation

In the `registerAddress()` function, if the address has previously been deleted, it should be removed from the `removedAddresses` array when it is registered again.
