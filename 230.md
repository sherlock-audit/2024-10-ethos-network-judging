# Anyone can bulkInviteAddresses() after registerAddress() to a random profile exhausting the invite limit

### Summary

Attacker can register address to a random profile and bulk invite to addresses to exhaust the invite limit, DOS-ing the actual user from inviting anyone.

[invite](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L248-L252)
[register](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L373-L408)

### Root Cause

The root cause is that anyone can register an address attached to any profile ID

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `maxNumberOfAddresses` of profile id is not reached yet allowing others to register addresses to the profile id.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker registers his own address to the target profile id
2. Attacker uses `bulkInviteAddresses` to burn through the invites allocated to profile id

### Impact

Any profile Id is at risk to completely lose all its invites to an attacker

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Have approval-based additions of new registered addresses to the profile id where existing addresses approve the new registering address to the profile id.
