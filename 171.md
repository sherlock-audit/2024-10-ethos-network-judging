# reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId mapping is not updated even when an attestation is claimed by another user .

### Summary

when a review is added on an attestation, [the protocol retrieves the associated profile](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosReview.sol#L195) .

After that, the protocol links that review to that profile  [by adding the review to `reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId` mapping array](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosReview.sol#L245-L248). 

However, there are instances where an attestation does not belong to that profile and is claimed by its real owner . Consequently, the initial subject of the review will still have that review associated to him in his reviews array because it hasnâ€™t been updated. As a result, the reviews recorded for this subject will remain inaccurate and unchanged. This can mislead public opinion and negatively impact the credibility and reputation of the initial subject (initial profile).

### Root Cause

the review on the attestation being claimed by another user is not removed from `reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId[subjectProfileId]` array of the initial profile .
