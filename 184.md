# No Profile Creation Fee Permits Malicious Actors to Create Multiple Accounts, Resulting in Reputation Manipulation

**Description**

if we read the [ethos network docs](https://whitepaper.ethos.network/), we understand that each action user takes in this network (voting, attestations, reviews, replies and vouches which is out of scope for this contest) that targets an activity item, it will impact users credibility. therefore we should mititgate such attacks where malicious actor can boost his crediblity easily.

Currently, the profile creation mechanism does not require users to pay a fee; for this reason, a malicious actor can easily invite their other addresses to create profile without paying anything and then leave upvotes, positive reviews/comments on themselves and their attestations, easily gaining more reputation and credibility scores.

**Impact**

A malicious actor can make themselves appear to be a credible and reputable person. Since reputation in the world we live in is everything, one way a malicious actor can use their reputation is to scam other people, engage in pump-and-dump schemes, phishing schemes, promote scams, and more...

**Recommended mitigation**

* Enforce that users pay a fee when [creating a profile](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L152-L172) in the Ethos Network. This will also motivate users to care more and be more active within the Ethos Network. However, be cautious in choosing the amount users pay when creating a profile; it should not be so high that it discourages new users from joining the Ethos Network, nor should it be so low that it allows malicious actors to operate freely within the network.

* each new invitee that gets invited, must pay more than the amount previous invitee payed. lets explain with an example:

1. lets say `User1` is a valid ethos user.
   
2. `User1` invites `User2`. `User2` must pay `1e18 ETH`, when creating a profile in ethos network. (this amount is hypothetical and will decided by ethos network team.)
   
3. `User1` invites `User3`. `User3` must pay `1e18 + 100 ETH`, when creating a profile in ethos network.
   
4. `User1` invites `User4`. `User4` must pay `1e18 + 200 ETH`, when creating a profile in ethos network.
   
5. `User1` invites `User5`. `User5` must pay `1e18 + 300 ETH`, when creating a profile in ethos network.

Essentially, each user User1 `invites` must pay more than the previous invitee.

This mitigates the risk of User1 inviting their other addresses to join the network and artificially boosting their credibility.

* Also, donâ€™t forget to implement a function in `EthosProfile` so the owner can withdraw accrued fees.
