# Deleted(Compromised) addresses can still invite users.

### Summary

when `deleteAddressAtIndex()` is called on an address it removes it from the `addresses` array in that profile's struct and marks it as compromised `( isAddressCompromised[addressStr] = true;) `, but it `inviteAddress()` does not check if the `inviter` is compromised before granting permission to invite other users. It only checks if the `invitee` has been compromised with the ` checkIfCompromised(invitee)` modifier.
Hence even after a user has deleted a wallet that has been compromised the attacker can still invite other addresses to Ethos with the profile.

### Root Cause

-  `inviteAddress()` only checks  if  the `msg.sender` is verified, not a mock and not archived but doesn't check if it's been compromised.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Address needs to have been previously `registered` to a previously existing  profile 
2. The account gets compromised and gets deleted and labelled as compromised 


### External pre-conditions

1. The address needs to be compromised by an attacker.

### Attack Path

1. The compromised/deleted address calls `inviteAddress()` with a clean/valid `invitee` address.  

### Impact

- The legitimate owner of the profile could lose control of his Ethos profile, cast unwanted votes and reviews (for scam products/profiles).
- The Attacker could fill the owners profile with spam addresses of his own in order to cast spam votes and reviews. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

consider adding the ` checkIfCompromised()` modifier for the `inviter` and not just for the `invitee` in `inviteAddress()`
