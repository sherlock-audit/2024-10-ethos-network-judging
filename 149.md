# Attestation data can be manipulated by the attacker due to improper `string` datatype hashing

### Summary

In [Ethos Attestation Contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L521C1-L529C4), attestation hash is created with improper method. Attacker can manipulate user's attestation details with front-running.

### Root Cause

Attestation creation needs a signature to verify it's authorized to create attestation with proof. But due to improper handling of `string` datatype in hashing, signature will represent many other attestation details and it will be open to front-running attacks. 

```solidity
  function _keccakForCreateAttestation(
    uint256 profileId,
    uint256 randValue,
    string calldata account,
    string calldata service,
    string calldata evidence
  ) private pure returns (bytes32) {
    return keccak256(abi.encodePacked(profileId, randValue, account, service, evidence));                                                                                               
  }
```
`string` datatype is a dynamic datatype and it's length can be changed depends on the data. `abi.encodePacked()` will generate same results for strings due to missing padding.

For instance:

Type 1:

- Account: "DemoreXTess"
- Service: "Discord"
- Evidence: "ABC"


Type2 :

- Account: "DemoreXT"
- Service: "essDiscordA"
- Evidence: "BC"

Those two types of the attestation details will be exactly same due to `abi.encodePacked()` usage with `string` datatype and attacker can easily frontrun legit user's transaction with same signature but with wrong attestation details as shown above.

In addition the following execution is also wrong because of same behaviour

```solidity
  function getServiceAndAccountHash(
    string calldata service,
    string calldata account
  ) public pure returns (bytes32) {
    if (bytes(service).length == 0 || bytes(account).length == 0) {
      revert AttestationInvalid(service, account);
    }
    return keccak256(abi.encodePacked(service, account));
  }
```


### Internal pre-conditions

- None

### External pre-conditions

- An user should try to claim an attestation

### Impact

Medium - This attack vector is really easy for an attacker and attacker can change every the attestation details of the user by simply front-running the transaction.

### Mitigation

Instead use following hashing method will generate unique hash for every unique input:

```solidity
keccak256(abi.encodePacked(profileId, randValue, keccak256(account), keccak256(service), keccak256(evidence)));
```
