# Missing `_disableInitializers` in constructor enables reinitialization of implementation contract

### Summary

The missing `_disableInitializers` in the constructor of UUPS contracts will cause potential reinitialization risk as anyone can invoke an initializer on the implementation contract directly.

### Root Cause

In UUPS contracts, the `_disableInitializers` call is missing from the constructor. Without this call, the implementation contract remains uninitialized and can be invoked by anyone to run an initializer function on it.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The contract must lack `_disableInitializers` in the constructor.
2. The implementation contract must be deployed in a way that allows direct interaction.
3. The contract must include at least one `initializer` function callable externally.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. An external user must attempt to initialize the UUPS implementation contract.
2. Contract deployment is public, allowing unauthorized access if initialized.

### Impact

The protocol suffers potential state corruption or unauthorized configuration changes, which may lead to malfunction or loss of control over contract behavior. The attacker gains control over the initialization process and can modify contract parameters maliciously.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add `_disableInitializers()` to the constructor of each UUPS implementation contract to prevent the risk of reinitialization.

  constructor() {
    _disableInitializers();
  }
