# Bypassable Self-Review Check Allows Manipulated Self-Scoring

### Summary

The addReview function in EthosAttestation.sol intends to prevent users from reviewing their own profiles, yet the self-review restriction can be bypassed if users add reviews before registering their account or creating attestations.

### Root Cause

The _validateReviewDetails function checks for self-reviews by verifying that the authorProfileId differs from the subjectProfileId (or the profile associated with the attestation). However, if a user submits a review before creating an attestation or registering their account, the subjectProfileId will be Zero, allowing the user to bypass the self-review check.

```solidity

    uint256 authorProfileId = _getEthosProfile().profileIdByAddress(msg.sender);
    if (subject != address(0)) {
      // if reviewing by address, check if the author's profile is the same as the subject's profile
      uint256 subjectProfileId = _getEthosProfile().profileIdByAddress(subject);
      if (authorProfileId == subjectProfileId) {
        revert SelfReview(subject);
      }
    } else {
      // if reviewing by attestation, check if the author's profile is the same as the subject's profile
      bytes32 attestationHash = _getEthosAttestation().getServiceAndAccountHash(
        attestationDetails.service,
        attestationDetails.account
      );
      uint256 subjectProfileId = _getEthosProfile().profileIdByAttestation(attestationHash);
      if (authorProfileId == subjectProfileId) {
        revert SelfReview(subject);
      }
    }

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The user’s account or attestation for the address has not been registered with EthosProfile before submitting a review.
2. The contract does not require an existing profile or attestation target to submit a review.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The user submits a self-review for an address that does not yet have an associated profile or attestation, effectively bypassing the SelfReview check.
2. After the review is accepted and counted towards the user’s score, the user registers their account or creates an attestation.
3. As the contract does not validate prior review data, the user now has a boosted score from a self-review.

### Impact

Users can inflate their reputation scores by leaving positive reviews for their own unregistered profile or attestation

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Require target profiles or attestations to be registered and verified before allowing users to submit reviews
