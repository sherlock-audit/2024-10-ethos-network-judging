# `deleteAddressAtIndex` function will add incorrect address to `removedAddresses`

### Summary

The `deleteAddressAtIndex` function in the `EthosProfile` contract has a bug where the incorrect address is added to the `removedAddresses` array when attempting to unregister an address from a profile. This issue can lead to inaccurate tracking of removed addresses and potential inconsistencies in the contract’s data.

### Root Cause

In `EthosProfile.sol:584`, the `_deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray` function mistakenly assigns the last address in the `addresses` array to the `removedAddresses` array instead of the address located at the specified index. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L584-L593

The root cause is that `_deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray` does not preserve the original address at `index` before swapping it with the last element in `addresses`, causing the wrong address to be added to `removedAddresses`.

### Attack Path

1. **User (Profile Owner) calls `deleteAddressAtIndex` with a specific index:**
   - The user intends to remove an address from their profile's `addresses` array. The function should add the removed address to `removedAddresses` for accurate historical tracking.

2. **Function proceeds to `_deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray`:**
   - The `deleteAddressAtIndex` function internally calls `_deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray`, which attempts to delete the address at the given index.

3. **Incorrect Address Added to `removedAddresses`:**
   - Due to the bug, `_deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray` mistakenly moves the last address in the `addresses` array to `removedAddresses` rather than the address at the specified index. This incorrect address entry can lead to inaccurate historical records, which may be exploited if tracking address integrity is essential to the contract’s functionality.

4. **Potential Exploitation of Mismanaged Data:**
   - An attacker could exploit this data inconsistency to manipulate or bypass intended contract restrictions, as certain addresses may appear unremoved or incorrectly managed. Over time, this could create vulnerabilities in profile management functions dependent on accurate address tracking (e.g., compromised address handling, permissions).

### Impact

1. **Inaccurate Address Tracking:**
   - The bug leads to incorrect tracking of addresses removed from profiles. This results in inconsistent historical data, undermining the integrity of the `removedAddresses` array, which is crucial for record-keeping and any functions relying on past address data.

2. **Compromised Data Integrity:**
   - The inaccuracy in `removedAddresses` could lead to vulnerabilities in profile-related operations, especially those involving permissions, compromised address handling, and invite/authorization mechanisms, as the contract may mistakenly assume addresses are active or inactive in a profile.

3. **Security Exploits:**
   - Attackers could exploit the tracking error to manipulate profile addresses, potentially bypassing restrictions on compromised accounts or re-registering addresses that should have been flagged as removed. This could lead to unauthorized actions within the network, as addresses marked as compromised or removed could still interact with the contract incorrectly.

4. **User Frustration and Loss of Trust:**
   - Mismanagement of user profiles and addresses could erode user confidence in the system, especially if legitimate addresses appear compromised or removed. This lack of trust could impact the adoption and growth of the Ethos Network.

### Mitigation

 **Code Fix in `_deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray`:**
   - Update `_deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray` to correctly add the address at the specified index to `removedAddresses` before modifying the `addresses` array.
   - Use the following code to ensure only the intended address is added to `removedAddresses`:

     ```solidity
     function _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray(
         uint256 index,
         address[] storage addresses,
         address[] storage removedAddresses
     ) private {
         // Store the address at the specified index to be deleted
         address addrToRemove = addresses[index];
         // Add the address to be removed to the removedAddresses array
         removedAddresses.push(addrToRemove);

         // If the index is not the last position, move the last element to the index position
         if (index < addresses.length - 1) {
             addresses[index] = addresses[addresses.length - 1];
         }
         // Remove the last element from the addresses array
         addresses.pop();
     }
     ```
