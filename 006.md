# `unvouchUnhealthy` method can never succeed in normal circumstances

### Summary

The `unvouchUnhealthy` method is a convenience method that allows you to execute `unvouch` and `markUnhealthy` at once.
```solidity
  function unvouchUnhealthy(uint256 vouchId) external {
    unvouch(vouchId);
    markUnhealthy(vouchId);
  }
```

For the `unvouchUnhealthy` method to execute successfully, both the `unvouch` and `markUnhealthy` methods must succeed, but the value of `activityCheckpoints.unvouchedAt` causes the `markUnhealthy` method to always fail.

1. `activityCheckpoints.unvouchedAt` uses `_vouchShouldBePossibleUnhealthy` method to check if the vouch could become unhealthy, which checks if the current `block.timestamp` is greater than `activityCheckpoints.unvouchedAt + unhealthyResponsePeriod`.
```solidity
  function unvouch(uint256 vouchId) public {
    uint256 profileId = IEthosProfile(
      contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(ETHOS_PROFILE)
    ).verifiedProfileIdForAddress(msg.sender);
    Vouch storage v = vouches[vouchId];
    _vouchShouldExist(vouchId);
    _vouchShouldBelongToAuthor(vouchId, profileId);
    _vouchShouldBePossibleUnvouch(vouchId);

    v.archived = true;
    // solhint-disable-next-line not-rely-on-time
    v.activityCheckpoints.unvouchedAt = block.timestamp;
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L281

2. The `markUnhealthy` method requires that the current `block.timestamp` is greater than `activityCheckpoints.unvouchedAt + unhealthyResponsePeriod` to succeed.
```solidity
  function _vouchShouldBePossibleUnhealthy(uint256 vouchId) private view {
    Vouch storage v = vouches[vouchId];
    bool stillHasTime = block.timestamp <=
      v.activityCheckpoints.unvouchedAt + unhealthyResponsePeriod;
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L459

3. The default value of `unhealthyResponsePeriod` is set in the `initialize` method and is 24 hours.
```solidity
  function initialize(
    address _owner,
    address _admin,
    address _expectedSigner,
    address _signatureVerifier,
    address _contractAddressManagerAddr,
    address _weth
  ) external initializer {
    __accessControl_init(
      _owner,
      _admin,
      _expectedSigner,
      _signatureVerifier,
      _contractAddressManagerAddr
    );

    __UUPSUpgradeable_init();

    configuredMinimumVouchAmount = ABSOLUTE_MINIMUM_VOUCH_AMOUNT;
    unhealthyResponsePeriod = 24 hours;
```

### Root Cause

In `unvouch` method, we set `activityCheckpoints.unvouchedAt` value to `block.timestamp`, and in `markUnhealthy`, we check if `block.timestamp` is greater than `activityCheckpoints.unvouchedAt + unhealthyResponsePeriod`, so `unvouchUnhealthy` method always fails if `unhealthyResponsePeriod` is not 0.
