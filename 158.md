# Compromised addresses can take action in the profile

### Summary

In Ethos Social Network, users can delete their previously registered addresses. Those deleted accounts are counted as compromised account in the protocol. But those accounts still can take action in the protocol due to missing validations.

### Root Cause

In following contracts, there are many actions that user can take while using Ethos social network. Compromised accounts still can take those actions after deletion due to missing check.

- Ethos Voter
- Ethos Review
- Ethos Attestation
- Ethos Discussion

In all the contracts, `profileId`  fetched using external call through `EthosProfile` contract. But this call doesn't check the address is compromised or not.

```solidity
  function verifiedProfileIdForAddress(address _address) external view returns (uint256) {
@>  (bool verified, bool archived, bool mock, uint256 profileId) = profileStatusByAddress(_address);
    if (!verified || archived || mock) {
      revert ProfileNotFoundForAddress(_address);
    }
    return profileId;
  }
```

```solidity
  function profileStatusByAddress(
    address addressStr
  ) public view returns (bool verified, bool archived, bool mock, uint256 profileId) {
    profileId = profileIdByAddress[addressStr];
    (verified, archived, mock) = profileStatusById(profileId);
  }
```

`profileIdByAddress` state variable is still holding the compromised account address after address removal.

```solidity
  function deleteAddressAtIndex(uint256 addressIndex) external whenNotPaused {
    uint256 profileId = profileIdByAddress[msg.sender];
    (bool verified, bool archived, bool mock) = profileStatusById(profileId);
    if (!verified) {
      revert ProfileNotFoundForAddress(msg.sender);
    }
    if (archived || mock) {
      revert ProfileAccess(profileId, "Profile is archived");
    }

    address[] storage addresses = profiles[profileId].addresses;
    address[] storage removedAddresses = profiles[profileId].removedAddresses;
    if (addresses.length <= addressIndex) {
      revert InvalidIndex();
    }

    address addressStr = addresses[addressIndex];
    isAddressCompromised[addressStr] = true;
    _addressShouldDifferFromSender(addressStr);

    _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray(addressIndex, addresses, removedAddresses);

    emit AddressClaim(profileId, addressStr, AddressClaimStatus.Unclaimed);
  }
```

### Impact

High - Compromised accounts are not properly removed from the profile. They have still 100% access to account because `verifiedProfileIdForAddress` will return `profileId`. In all the contracts, `profileId` check is maden by this external function. 

In conclusion, compromised address still can:

- Vote
- Add review
- Add reply 
- Claim Attestation
etc...

### Mitigation

While remove action delete the address from the `profileIdByAddress` state variable.
