# Overwriting Profile IDs Causes Review Inconsistencies

### Summary

When a user submits a review for an address or attestation without an existing profile or attestation hash, a mock profile ID is created through incrementProfileCount to track the review. However, if the address is registered or  attestation is created, the new profile overwrites the previous mock ID, causing discrepancies in the review data. This issue leads to the loss of valid review data, affecting the user who has already paid fees.

### Root Cause

When `addReview` is called for a subject or attestation without an existing profile or profile ID, a mock profile ID is generated. 

```solidity
  function _addReview(
    uint256 mockId,
    address subject,
    bool isAttestation,
    bytes32 attestationHash,
    IEthosProfile ethosProfile
  ) internal returns (uint256 subjectProfileId) {
    // if profileId does not exist for subject, create and record a "mock"
    if (mockId == 0) {
      subjectProfileId = ethosProfile.incrementProfileCount(
        isAttestation,
        subject,
        attestationHash
      );
    } else {
      subjectProfileId = mockId;
    }
```

If the reviewed user registers the profile or creates an attestation, the new profile ID overwrites the mock ID in profileIdByAddress or profileIdByAttestation. Since EthosReview continues to reference the original mock ID for reviews, this causes discrepancies and may invalidate user reviews tied to the mock profile ID.

```solidity
  function registerAddress(
    address addressStr,
    uint256 profileId,
    uint256 randValue,
    bytes calldata signature
  ) external whenNotPaused onlyNonZeroAddress(addressStr) {
    (bool verified, bool archived, bool mock) = profileStatusById(profiled);
    // ...
    profiles[profileId].addresses.push(addressStr);
   //@audit mockId is overwritten 
    profileIdByAddress[addressStr] = profileId;

```

```solidity
  function createAttestation(
    uint256 profileId,
    uint256 randValue,
    AttestationDetails calldata attestationDetails,
    string calldata evidence,
    bytes calldata signature
  ) external whenNotPaused {

// ...
    IEthosProfile(ethosProfile).assignExistingProfileToAttestation(hashStr, profileId);
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. addReview is called on a subject address or attestation without an existing profile or profile ID.
2. The owner of the address or web2 account later registers the subject address or creates an attestation for the same entity, overwriting the previous mock profile ID with the actual profile ID.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The current design allows for the overwriting of mock profileIds when a real profile is later created for the same user. This creates a misalignment between original review IDs and updated profile IDs, leading to inaccuracies in review data retrieval and view functions. As a result:
Reviews previously associated with a mock profile ID are no longer correctly linked to the userâ€™s updated profile, creating inconsistencies in reviewsBySubjectInRange, reviewsByAttestationHashInRange, and similar functions.
Scores and review counts may no longer reflect accurate information, and fees paid for creating these reviews become ineffective, as reviews are essentially detached from the updated profile records

### PoC

```solidity
    it('should overwrite the mockId', async () => {
      const { ethosReview, ethosProfile, EXPECTED_SIGNER, REVIEW_CREATOR_0, REVIEW_SUBJECT_0, OWNER } =
        await loadFixture(deployFixture);

      let profileID = await inviteAndCreateProfile(ethosProfile, OWNER, REVIEW_CREATOR_0);

      await ethosReview
        .connect(REVIEW_CREATOR_0)
        .addReview(
          Score.Positive,
          REVIEW_SUBJECT_0.address,
          ethers.ZeroAddress,
          'Test comment',
          'Test metadata',
          { account: '', service: '' },
        );

      const review = await ethosReview.reviews(0);
      const reviewIds = await ethosReview.reviewIdsBySubjectAddress(REVIEW_SUBJECT_0.address);
      expect(review.reviewId).to.equal(reviewIds[0], 'Subject profile ID should be stored');
      let profileId = await ethosProfile.profileIdByAddress(REVIEW_SUBJECT_0.address);
      //@audit mockId is assigned
      let mockId = 3;
      expect(profileId).to.be.equal(mockId, 'should be 3');

      expect(
        await ethosReview.numberOfReviewsBy(
          ReviewsBy.Subject,
          mockId,
          ethers.ZeroHash,
        ),
      ).to.equal(1);

      const signature = await common.signatureForRegisterAddress(
        REVIEW_SUBJECT_0.address,
        profileID,
        '29548234957',
        EXPECTED_SIGNER,
      );

      await ethosProfile
        .connect(REVIEW_CREATOR_0)
        .registerAddress(REVIEW_SUBJECT_0.address, 2, 29548234957, signature);

      //@audit profilId is overwritten
      expect(await ethosProfile.profileIdByAddress(REVIEW_SUBJECT_0.address)).to.be.equal(
        profileID,
        'wrong profileId',
      );

      //@audit review still use mockId
      expect(
        await ethosReview.numberOfReviewsBy(
          ReviewsBy.Subject,
          mockId,
          ethers.ZeroHash,
        ),
      ).to.equal(1);
      //@audit new profileId doesnt have any review
      expect(
        await ethosReview.numberOfReviewsBy(
          ReviewsBy.Subject,
          profileID,
          ethers.ZeroHash,
        ),
      ).to.equal(0);
    });
```

### Mitigation

Implement an update mechanism that remaps or updates old review IDs when a mock profile or attestation ID is replaced by a registered profile ID. This function should reassign review data to the correct profile or attestation
