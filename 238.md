# Malicious Actor Can Prevent Inviter from Sending Invitations Indefinitely by Registering and Unregistering Invitee Before Invitation Is Sent

**Description**

If an inviter attempts to send an invitation to `user1` by calling the [EthosProfile::inviteAddress()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L202-L239) function, a malicious actor can prevent this by front-running the inviter’s transaction. The malicious actor intercepts the transaction and:

1. Calls the [EthosProfile::registerAddress()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L364-L409) function to register `user1` to their own profile.
2. Immediately calls the [EthosProfile::deleteAddressAtIndex()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L411-L438) function to unregister and compromise `user1` address. 

This sequence of actions causes the inviter’s transaction to fail and revert, as `user1` no longer meets the criteria to receive an invitation since `inviteAddress()` function, allows the inviter to only [invite non-compromised addresses](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L210).

The malicious actor can repeat this process indefinitely, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) attack that prevents the inviter from being able to send invitations to any user.

**Impact**

A malicious actor can indefinitely prevent a specific inviter from sending invitations to a particular user.

By repeatedly registering and unregistering the targeted user, the attacker can cause the inviter's transactions to fail and revert.

This creates a denial-of-service (DoS) situation where the inviter is unable to invite the targeted user for as long as the attacker continues this action.

This vulnerability disrupts the invitation process, allowing the attacker to selectively block specific users from joining or participating in the ethos network.

**Recommended Mitigation**

* implement Invitation Lock Mechanism:
  
  Once an invitation is initiated by the `inviter`, temporarily lock the `invitee` registration status, preventing any registration or unregistration actions from other users until the invitation process is complete.
