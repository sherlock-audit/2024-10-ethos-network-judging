# Invite limit can be bypassed in current system design

### Summary

In Ethos Social Network, every new user ( profile ) has some default invite numbers which is set at the creation of the profile. But this invite limit is useless and can't be applied in current [protocol design](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L158C1-L172C4).

### Root Cause

The root cause of the problem is the system design of the protocol. Every new user has some default invite numbers. There is no any more limitation in this design such as off-chain signature verification by trusted Ethos App. 

If someone invites you to the network. You will have some invites number, you can invite your another wallet address to the network and then this account will also have same number of invites. You can use that account for inviting your another address again and again. There is no limitation and this situation makes the invite system useless.

### Code Snippet

```solidity
// Creating profile
  function createProfile(uint256 inviterId) external whenNotPaused {
    (
      bool inviteSenderVerified,
      bool inviteSenderArchived,
      bool inviteSenderIsMock
    ) = profileStatusById(inviterId);
    if (!inviteSenderVerified || inviteSenderArchived || inviteSenderIsMock) {
      revert InvalidSender();
    }
    _inviterProfileAuthorizedSender(inviterId, msg.sender);

    uint256 newID = _createProfile(msg.sender);
    profiles[newID].inviteInfo.invitedBy = inviterId;
    profiles[inviterId].inviteInfo.acceptedIds.push(newID);
  }

  function _createProfile(address user) internal returns (uint256 profileId) {
    (bool verified, , bool mock, uint256 existingProfileId) = profileStatusByAddress(user);
    if (verified) {
      revert ProfileExists(existingProfileId);
    } else if (mock) { 
      profileId = existingProfileId;
    } else {
      profileId = profileCount;
      profileCount++;
    }

    profileIdByAddress[user] = profileId;
    profiles[profileId].profileId = profileId;
    profiles[profileId].createdAt = block.timestamp;
@>  profiles[profileId].inviteInfo.available = defaultNumberOfInvites;
    profiles[profileId].addresses.push(user);

    emit ProfileCreated(profileId, user);
    return profileId;
  }
```


### Attack Path

There can be many attack path in this situation. Because in this circumstances, attacker can have many profiles and he can manipulate almost anything in the system such as votes, reviews, replies. 

1. Alice invited her friend Bob to the network
2. Bob wants to get high amounts of vote and positive review.
3. He created some bots for it and invited many accounts to the system.
4. Using those accounts, he reached high amount of votes and positive review

### Impact

High - In this situation attacker can manipulate the system and current situation there is no way to prevent attacker. There is no ban system for the authority, so no way to ban attacker in this situation.


### Mitigation

It's a little bit tricky problem but my professional advice is giving invite permission to profiles who has some specific requirements such as claimed attestation.
