# A compromised address in a profile can make it impossible to add more addresses to a profile

### Summary

When an address is removed, it is flagged in Profile::removedAddresses[] and then removed from the Profile::addresses[] list. These removed addresses can re-register, and when they do, the `invitee` address is added back to Profile::addresses[] but not removed from Profile::removedAddresses[]. _This creates a duplicate entry, which may push the recorded addresses in a profile to the maximum capacity more quickly than expected._

### Root Cause

When an address in a profile is compromised, it is removed through 'EthosProfile::deleteAddressAtIndex()`. 

```solidity
  function _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray(
    uint256 index,
    address[] storage addresses,
    address[] storage removedAddresses
  ) private {
    address addr = addresses[addresses.length - 1];
    addresses[index] = addr;
    removedAddresses.push(addr);
    addresses.pop();
  }
```

To complete this operation, the compromised address is popped from the list of addresses associated with the profile and added to the list of compromised addresses.

However, when the compromised address is being re-registered in [`EthosProfile::registerAddress()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L373C2-L409C4), the compromised address is registered into the list of addresses.
```solidity
function registerAddress(
    address addressStr,
    uint256 profileId,
    uint256 randValue,
    bytes calldata signature
  ) external whenNotPaused onlyNonZeroAddress(addressStr) {
      ...............................
     profiles[profileId].addresses.push(addressStr);
      ...............................
}
```
At this point the compromised address is registered twice: in the removedAddresses list and the addresses list.

### How would an address/compromised address weaponize this?
This vulnerability can be weaponized by registering a bunch of random addresses and deleting them. Once they are deleted, they are re-registered. This effectively duplicates the addresses to max out the allowed number of addresses that can be registered.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. An address/compromised address (ALICE) registered to a profile invites 68 random addresses (addresses can be sourced through socials).
2. ALICE deletes the addresses, effectively registering them as compromised.
3. ALICE registers the compromised addresses again to max out the number of allowed addresses in the profile.

### Impact

the maximum number of addresses that can be added to a profile is 128, this can be easily maxed out, and until the maximum is raised, members of a profile will be unable to register addresses.
