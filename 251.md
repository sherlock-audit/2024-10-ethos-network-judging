# Fixing DoS Vulnerability in Ether Withdrawal: Replacing .transfer with .call to Prevent Fund Locking

### Summary

The withdrawFunds function uses transfer to send Ether to msg.sender if the paymentToken is the zero address (indicating native Ether). Since transfer forwards only 2300 gas, it can fail if the recipient is a contract with a fallback function that requires more than 2300 gas to execute, creating a Denial of Service (DoS) for these users.

### Root Cause

2300 Gas Limitation in .transfer: When transfer is used to send Ether, it forwards only 2300 gas, which is insufficient if the receiving address is a contract that has a complex fallback function or performs any storage operations.
