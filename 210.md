# SafeERC20 should be used to transfer tokens in EthosReview

### Summary

In EthosReview, when transferring ERC20 tokens, the raw ERC20 interface is used. However, this is not applicable for some common tokens, e.g. USDT.

### Root Cause

There may be two cases that token transfer would be buggy:

1. For tokens like USDT that doesn't have return value for `transfer`, `transerFrom`. The call would revert.
2. For tokens that doesn't revert on failure: https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20?tab=readme-ov-file#no-revert-on-failure. These are not that common though.

Considering USDT is a very common token, it should be supported. The fix is to use SafeERC20, it can solve both cases.

```solidity
  function withdrawFunds(address paymentToken) external onlyOwner {
    if (paymentToken == address(0)) {
      payable(msg.sender).transfer(address(this).balance);
    } else {
@>    IERC20(paymentToken).transfer(msg.sender, IERC20(paymentToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }
  }

    function _handlePayment(address paymentToken) private onlyValidPaymentToken(paymentToken) {
    uint256 price = reviewPrice[paymentToken].price;

    if (price > 0) {
      if (paymentToken == address(0)) {
        if (msg.value != price) {
          revert WrongPaymentAmount(paymentToken, msg.value);
        }
      } else {
        if (msg.value > 0) {
          revert WrongPaymentAmount(address(0), msg.value);
        }

@>      IERC20(paymentToken).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), price);
      }
    }
  }
```
