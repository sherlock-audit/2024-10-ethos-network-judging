# Self-review can easily bypassed

# H-01 Self-review can easily bypassed

## Summary
Users can bypass self-review restrictions by adding reviews for unregistered addresses, which creates a “mock” profile. They can then register the address under their profile, enabling self-reviews.

## Vulnerability Details
The `addReview` function includes self-review checks within the `_validateReviewDetails` helper function to prevent users from reviewing addresses associated with their Ethos profile. This function validates that the `subject` address is not the same as the reviewer’s (`msg.sende`r) and confirms that the `subject` isn't registered for the profile id:

```solidity
function _validateReviewDetails(address subject, AttestationDetails calldata attestationDetails) private view {
    // sender and subject are the exact same address
>>>    if (subject == msg.sender) {
      revert SelfReview(subject);
    }

    uint256 authorProfileId = _getEthosProfile().profileIdByAddress(msg.sender);
    if (subject != address(0)) {
      // if reviewing by address, check if the author's profile is the same as the subject's profile
      uint256 subjectProfileId = _getEthosProfile().profileIdByAddress(subject);
>>>      if (authorProfileId == subjectProfileId) {
        revert SelfReview(subject);
      }
    }
    // --SNIP
}
```
However, this validation can be circumvented by adding a review for a `subject` address that has not yet been registered in the Ethos network. In such cases, a "mock" profile is created for the `subject`:
```solidity
// EthosReview::addReview
function addReview( Score score, address subject, address paymentToken, string calldata comment, string calldata metadata,
    AttestationDetails calldata attestationDetails
) external payable whenNotPaused {
    // --snip
    if (subject != address(0)) {
      mockId = ethosProfile.profileIdByAddress(subject);
>>>      mockId = _addReview(mockId, subject, false, 0x0, ethosProfile);
    } else {//...}
    // --SNIP
}

function _addReview( uint256 mockId, address subject, bool isAttestation, bytes32 attestationHash, IEthosProfile ethosProfile) internal returns (uint256 subjectProfileId) {
    // if profileId does not exist for subject, create and record a "mock"
    if (mockId == 0) {
      subjectProfileId = ethosProfile.incrementProfileCount(
        isAttestation,
        subject,
        attestationHash
      );
    }
    // --SNIP
```
To bypass the self-review restrictions, a user could:
1. Adds a review for a `subject` address (an address associated with themselves) that is not yet registered in the Ethos profile system. This action [registers the review](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/979e352d7bcdba3d0665f11c0320041ce28d1b89/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosReview.sol#L248) and [generates a `mock` profile](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/979e352d7bcdba3d0665f11c0320041ce28d1b89/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosReview.sol#L239-L243) for the subject.
2. Subsequently, register the `subject` to his profile invoking [EthosProfile::registerAddress](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/979e352d7bcdba3d0665f11c0320041ce28d1b89/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L373-L409).


## Impact
Users can create self-reviews by exploiting unregistered addresses, bypassing the self-review validation in place.

## Mitigation
Two potential mitigation can be recommended:
- Do not allow a review of unregistered address.
- Within `EthosProfile::registerAddress`, ensure that the profile ID owner has not previously left a review for the `addressStr`
