# Deleted addresses by a user are not added to the removed addresses array as it should


## Impact
### Summary 
A user can delete an address associated with their profile by calling the `EthosProfile::deleteAddressAtIndex` and providing the index of the address to delete. The function is supposed to set the address to delete as compromised, remove the address from the `addresses` array and add the removed address to the `removedAddresses` array.
However, in actual implementation, the function does not add the removed address to the `removedAddresses` array.

### Vulnerability Details
The `EthosProfile::deleteAddressAtIndex` function indeed sets the address to delete as compromised and then calls the `EthosProfile::_deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray` which is supposed to remove the deleted address from the `addresses` array and add the same address to the `removedAddresses` array.
The `EthosProfile::_deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray` function uses the replace and pop method to remove an address from the `addresses` array. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the function does not cache the removed address before shifting the address at the last index to the index of the address to be removed. So in the end, it is the address that was previously at the last index of the `addresses` array that is added to the `removedAddresses` array. In effect, we end up with one address that is contained in both arrays i.e. the `addresses` array and the `removedAddresses` array. See https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L584-L593


```javascript
    function _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray(
    uint256 index,
    address[] storage addresses,
    address[] storage removedAddresses
  ) private {
    address addr = addresses[addresses.length - 1];
    addresses[index] = addr;
    removedAddresses.push(addr);
    addresses.pop();
  }

```


### Impact
As a result of this vulnerability, we end up with a situation where a removed address is no where to found in a user's profile when is should have been stored in the `removedAddresses` array.
Secondly, this results in having an address that is not removed from the `addresses` array also included in the `removedAddresses` array which ought not to be so.
Lastly, though a removed address is set as compromised, it is not linked to the profile that registered it. This is contrary to the intended protocol design which is aimed at linking all addresses to their profiles even after they are removed for historical tracking.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Consider the following mitigation steps
1. cache the address to be removed i.e. `removedAddr`
2. remove `removedAddr` from the `addresses` array using the replace and pop method, 
3. add `removedAddr` to the `removedAddresses` array.

```diff
    function _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray(
    uint256 index,
    address[] storage addresses,
    address[] storage removedAddresses
  ) private {
    address addr = addresses[addresses.length - 1];
+   address removedAddr = addresses[index];
    addresses[index] = addr;
-   removedAddresses.push(addr);
+   removedAddresses.push(removedAddr);
    addresses.pop();
  }

```
