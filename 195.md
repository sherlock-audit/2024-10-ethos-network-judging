# Archived ProfileIds can still perform multiple actions in Ethos system.


### Summary

A profileId can archive himself. When archived, this means the profile is disabled and cannot take any functional actions. The only action is to restore the profile back. - This was double-checked with the sponsor.

However, in the Ethos ecosystem, there are multiple functions that still can be accessed by archived profiles.

### Root Cause

1. `EthosReview # archiveReview()`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosReview.sol#L287
2. `EthosProfile # uninviteUser()`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L258
3. `EthosAttestation # archiveAttestation()`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L334
4. `EthosAttestation # createAttestation() -> _claimAttestation()` : https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L269
