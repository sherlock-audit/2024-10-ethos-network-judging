# `EthosVoten` `EthosDiscussion` are not compatible with the used contract upgrade mechanism

### Summary

The project uses a non-standard pattern that allows for updating contracts. The superior mechanism over UUPS is `ContractAddressManager`, which gives names to individual parts of the system and allows them to be exchanged (together with proxies) by changing the address of a given component. This will cause all data saved to a specific address, such as votes and discussions, to be lost, which in the case of social profiles is a huge loss.

### Root Cause

The Ethos project employs an unconventional upgrade pattern that allows for the seamless updating of contracts. While individual contract upgrades are managed using the UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard), which retains data upon implementation changes, the primary mechanism for overall system upgrades is through an AddressManager. This AddressManager assigns unique identifiers (names) to core components, allowing for complete implementation replacement by simply updating the associated address. This approach lets contracts refer to key components by name (e.g., "ETHOS_PROFILE" instead of a direct profile contract address).

Example:
```solidity
function _getEthosProfile() private view returns (address) {
    return contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(ETHOS_PROFILE);
  }
```

In the case of `EthosVote`, the problem is the `voteFor` function:

```solidity
  function voteFor(
    address targetContract,
    uint256 targetId,
    bool isUpvote
  )
```

[EthosVote.voteFor](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/979e352d7bcdba3d0665f11c0320041ce28d1b89/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVote.sol#L137-L137)

For `EthosDiscussion` the `addReply` function:

```solidity
  function addReply(
    address targetContract,
    uint256 targetId,
    string memory content,
    string memory metadata
  )
```

[EthosDiscussion.addReply](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/979e352d7bcdba3d0665f11c0320041ce28d1b89/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosDiscussion.sol#L105-L105)

Both functions assign data to `targetContract`, which can change, removing e.g. vote or discussion validation.

I rate the problem on Medium, because these are the main functions of these contracts, and the social data that is at risk and will be lost is the most important thing in such projects.
This can be compared to assigning data to a specific implementation instead of a proxy address.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Incorrectly pinned social data will be lost when contracts are updated using a custom project mechanism.

A mechanism that is supposed to allow for replacing some parts of the system without having to change other parts will result in data loss.

### Mitigation

As with reviews and other system elements, you should use the text identifiers of the project modules stored in [Constants.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/979e352d7bcdba3d0665f11c0320041ce28d1b89/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/utils/Constants.sol#L5-L5)
