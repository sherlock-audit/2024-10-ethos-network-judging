# invariant `One may not write to Ethos contracts until a (non-mock) profile is created.` is broken

### Summary

The protocol describes some invariants that should not be broken, these invariants can be observed below:

> One address may be associated with maximum one profile.
Profile creation requires at least one active invitation.
One may not write to Ethos contracts until a (non-mock) profile is created.

to be specific the invariant `One may not write to Ethos contracts until a (non-mock) profile is created.` is broken because it is possible for a user to call `archiveProfile` , `restoreProfile`, and `registerAddress` with a mock account, and thus breaking the invariant since the functions `archiveProfile` , `restoreProfile`, and `registerAddress` writes to an ethos contract.

### Root Cause

in `EthosReview.sol` ln 174

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosReview.sol#L173

```solidity
  function addReview(
    Score score,
    address subject,
    address paymentToken,
    string calldata comment,
    string calldata metadata,
    AttestationDetails calldata attestationDetails
  ) external payable whenNotPaused {
```

the function `addReview` allows a profile to leave a review for a `subject`. If the subject does not hold an ethos profile, a mock will be made for them. The problem is that by inputting specific values, a user can make a mock account and then call `archiveProfile` , `restoreProfile`, and `registerAddress` to write to the the ethosProfile contract and thus breaking the invariant.

Let me breakdown how this is done...

first a user must call `addReview` with subject that != 0 and a `subject` address that does not currently own a profile on the EthosProfile contract. The `subject` Address must be owned by the user to pull the remaining part of the exploit of aswell.

now lets go line by line to see the outcome...

```solidity
_validateReviewDetails(subject, attestationDetails);
```
with the following configuration this check will pass next...

```solidity
    if (subject != address(0)) {
      mockId = ethosProfile.profileIdByAddress(subject);
      mockId = _addReview(mockId, subject, false, 0x0, ethosProfile);
```
This if statement will be triggered which is what we need to pull of the exploit, the call `ethosProfile.profileIdByAddress(subject)`
will return 0 because as i stated before `subject` address is currently not associated with a profileId and thus the default value will be returned which is 0, next `mockID` is set to 0 and we call `_addReview` with the `mockID` = 0. Lets observe the consequence of this
```solidity
  function _addReview(
    uint256 mockId,
    address subject,
    bool isAttestation,
    bytes32 attestationHash,
    IEthosProfile ethosProfile
  ) internal returns (uint256 subjectProfileId) {
    // if profileId does not exist for subject, create and record a "mock"
    if (mockId == 0) {
      subjectProfileId = ethosProfile.incrementProfileCount(
        isAttestation,
        subject,
        attestationHash
      );
```
the first if statement is triggered and thus we will call `incrementProfileCount` let us see what happens next

```solidity
  function incrementProfileCount(
    bool isAttestation,
    address subject,
    bytes32 attestation
  ) external whenNotPaused returns (uint256 profileId) {
    if (
      msg.sender != contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(ETHOS_REVIEW) &&
      msg.sender != contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(ETHOS_ATTESTATION)
    ) {
      revert InvalidSender();
    }
    profileId = profileCount;
    if (isAttestation) {
      profileIdByAttestation[attestation] = profileId;
    } else {
      profileIdByAddress[subject] = profileId;
    }
    profileCount++;

    emit MockProfileCreated(profileId);
  }
```
We hit the else statement and we assign the `subjectAddress` (which is the users other wallet) to the next profileID

Now that the users wallet has been assigned a profileID the user has officially associated his address with a mock account. And since the mock account has a profileId, it no longer returns variable `mock` as true in the following functions:

```solidity
  function profileStatusById(
    uint256 profileId
  ) public view returns (bool verified, bool archived, bool mock) {
    Profile storage profile = profiles[profileId];
    verified = profile.profileId > 0;
    archived = verified && profile.archived;
    mock = profileId > 0 && !verified && profileId < profileCount;
  }

  /**
   * @dev Returns the status of a profile by its associated address.
   * @param addressStr The address to check.
   * @return verified Whether the profile is verified.
   * @return archived Whether the profile is archived.
   * @return mock Whether the profile is a mock profile.
   * @return profileId The ID of the profile associated with the address.
   */
  function profileStatusByAddress(
    address addressStr
  ) public view returns (bool verified, bool archived, bool mock, uint256 profileId) {
    profileId = profileIdByAddress[addressStr];
    (verified, archived, mock) = profileStatusById(profileId);
  }
```
these 2 checks are important to ensure a mock cannot write to the ethos contracts and i have shown how a user can take control of a mock account and with the same mock account bypass these checks. Now that he can pass these checks the mock account can do almost everything a regular account can do. Including calling `archiveProfile` , `restoreProfile`, and `registerAddress`. (note: can also call function `addReview`, `addReply`, and `voteFor` found this out after writing report)

Therefore the invariant `One may not write to Ethos contracts until a (non-mock) profile is created.` is broken.

and according to sherlock docs;

> The protocol team can use the README (and only the README) to define language that indicates the codebase's restrictions and/or expected functionality. Additionally, the protocol team can use only the following question to define the protocol's invariants/properties:

> What properties/invariants do you want to hold even if breaking them has a low/unknown impact?

> Issues that break the invariants from the above question, irrespective of whether the impact is low/unknown, will be assigned Medium severity. High severity will be applied only if the issue falls into the High severity category in the judging guidelines.

> Example: The README states "Admin can only call XYZ function once" but the code allows the Admin to call XYZ function twice; this is a valid Medium

This will qualify this issue as a valid medium.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. address must not have a profile on ethosprofile


### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. the address does not have an ethos profile associated to it
2. the user must call addReview with the address
3. the address will be assigned to a mock 
4. the address can call `archiveProfile` , `restoreProfile`, and `registerAddress`
5. a mock has been used to write to an ethos contract
6. the invariant `One may not write to Ethos contracts until a (non-mock) profile is created.` is broken

### Impact

breaking of a protocol invariant, allows a mock to write to an ethos contract

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation
Since the mock the user is controlling does not set the following values
```solidity
    profiles[profileId].profileId = profileId;
    profiles[profileId].createdAt = block.timestamp;
    profiles[profileId].inviteInfo.available = defaultNumberOfInvites;
    profiles[profileId].addresses.push(user);
```
We can prevent a mock account controlled by a user to interact with the protocol by using a check createdAt>0 in the functions  `archiveProfile` , `restoreProfile`, and `registerAddress`

This fix is not perfect so id recommend thinking about a fix that is more in depth and ensures that the invariant holds.
