# Unrestricted Uninviting from `Archived` or `Compromised` Profiles in `EthosProfile` Contract

### Summary

The `uninviteUser` function in the `EthosProfile` contract allows users to remove pending invites even when the inviter's profile is `archived` or their address is `compromised`, which should be restricted actions.

### Root Cause

In `EthosProfile.sol`, the `uninviteUser` function does not include checks to verify whether the inviter's profile is active or if the inviter's address is compromised. This oversight allows users to uninvite addresses from profiles that should be inactive.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The inviter must have a valid profile ID.
2. The inviter must not be archived or have a compromised address.
3. The address being uninvited must be present in the inviter's list of sent invites.

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. A user with an archived profile or a compromised address calls the uninviteUser function, specifying the address of the invitee.
2. The function retrieves the inviter's profile and checks if the user exists in the sent invites.
3. Since there are no checks on the profile status or the inviter's address integrity, the invite is successfully removed, even though it should not have been permitted.

### Impact

This vulnerability allows users to manipulate the invite system, potentially affecting the integrity of user interactions within the Ethos Network. It undermines the accountability of profiles and could lead to abuse by users whose profiles should be inactive, such as those who have been compromised or archived.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To address this issue, additional checks should be introduced in the uninviteUser function to ensure that the inviter's profile is active and that their address is not compromised before allowing the uninvitation.
