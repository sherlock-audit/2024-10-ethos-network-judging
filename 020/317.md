# Some Users may get less invites than other after setDefaultNumberOfInvites is called

### Summary

Due to the fact that the `defaultNumberOfInvites` is cached on creation of profile, anytime the `defaultNumberOfInvites` is updated by admin, all previous profiles will not be affected and will still retain previous value of `defaultNumberOfInvites`

### Root Cause

Caching of defaultNumberOfInvites allows previously created profiles to not get effect of changes made to defaultNumberOfInvites

This can be seen in various scenarios, if the `EthosProfile` contract is newly deployed, anyone who creates profile before the `setDefaultNumberOfInvites` will still have `profiles[profiled].available = 0` and will require admin to manually increase count of invite for each user profile already created.

### Internal pre-conditions

1) Profile needs to be minted before `setDefaultNumberOfInvites` is called

### External pre-conditions

1) Profile needs to be minted before `setDefaultNumberOfInvites` is called

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

1) Inconsistent accounting
2) loss of gas 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

cache the invites so far and subtract from the defaultNumberOfInvites instead,
e.g: `uint available = defaultNumberOfInvites - profiles[profiled].used;`
