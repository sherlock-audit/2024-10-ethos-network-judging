# Inviter Has Ability to Make Invitee Profile Creation Fail and Revert

**Description**

lets say we have two users:

* `Alice` has an active Ethos profile.
* `Bob` does not have any profile in the Ethos Network yet.

1. `Alice` sends an invite to `Bob` to come and Join Ethos Network by creating a profile with calling [EthosProfile::InviteAddress()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L202-L239) function.

2. `Bob` Accepts the invite and calls [EthosProfile::createProfile()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L152-L172) function.

3. `Alice` can Front Run `Bob` and make profile creation fail for him by either [Archiving her Profile](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L325-L343) or [Un-Inviting](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L254-L280) `Bob`. This is possible because, within the `createProfile()` function we first verify that [inviter profile is active(verified, not archived, not mock)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L159-L166) and then we verify [whether or not inviter has invited the invitee](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L167) (in this case is `Bob`).


**Impact**

allows a malicious inviter to prevent a user from creating a profile in the Ethos Network By front-running the `createProfile()` transaction.

the inviter can render their profile archived or remove the sent invite for invitee, leading to a failed profile creation for the invitee. This can result in a poor user experience, as the invitee may be denied access to the network without a clear reason.

**Recommended mitigation**

1. We should not care about whether or not the inviter's profile (in this case, `Alice`) is currently active; we should only ensure that at some point in time, the inviter's profile was active and verified. This means refactoring [this code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L159-L166) to the following:

```diff
  function createProfile(uint256 inviterId) external whenNotPaused {
-   (
-     bool inviteSenderVerified,
-     bool inviteSenderArchived,
-     bool inviteSenderIsMock
-   ) = profileStatusById(inviterId);
-   if (!inviteSenderVerified || inviteSenderArchived || inviteSenderIsMock) {
-     revert InvalidSender();
-   }
+   address ethosProfile = address(this);
+   (bool exist,) = ITargetStatus(ethosProfile).targetExistsAndAllowedForId(inviterId);
+   if (!exist) revert InvalidEthosProfile();
    _inviterProfileAuthorizedSender(inviterId, msg.sender);

    uint256 newID = _createProfile(msg.sender);
    profiles[newID].inviteInfo.invitedBy = inviterId;
    profiles[inviterId].inviteInfo.acceptedIds.push(newID);
  }
```

2. Add a mechanism that, if the invitee accepts an invite from the inviter (let's say by calling an `acceptInvite()` function, it's a hypothetical function), they can create a profile whenever they want. This prevents the inviter from un-inviting the invitee just before the profile creation process, thus making the profile creation fail and revert.
