# Unlimited Profile Creation Through Race Condition in Invite System

### Summary

A race condition in the invite verification system will cause **unlimited profile creation for malicious users as attacker will exploit parallel transactions** to create multiple profiles with a single invite

### Root Cause

In `EthosProfile.sol` the invite verification in `_inviterProfileAuthorizedSender` removes the invite after verification but doesn't use any synchronization mechanism, allowing race conditions

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Attacker needs one valid invite from an existing profile
2. The network should allow parallel transaction execution
3. The attacker needs enough ETH to submit multiple transactions simultaneously

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker receives a valid invite from an existing profile
2. Attacker prepares multiple identical createProfile transactions with the same invite
3. Attacker submits these transactions in parallel
4. Due to the race condition, **multiple transactions can pass the invite verification before the invite is removed**
5. Multiple profiles are created using a single invite

### Impact

- The protocol suffers from **unauthorized profile creation**, undermining the entire invite-based security model. The attacker gains multiple profiles from a single invite.

### Mitigation

**Implement a transaction lock or use OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard to prevent parallel execution of profile creation. Additionally, consider implementing a nonce-based invite system.**
