# invariant `One address may be associated with maximum one profile` is broken

### Summary

The protocol describes a few invariants that should not be broken otherwise they would result in a valid issue.
The invariant are listed below:
> One address may be associated with maximum one profile.
Profile creation requires at least one active invitation.
One may not write to Ethos contracts until a (non-mock) profile is created.

The invariant `One address may be associated with maximum one profile` is broken because the `createProfile` function does not check if an address is compromised.

### Root Cause

in EthosProfile.sol ln 158
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L158

```solidity
  function createProfile(uint256 inviterId) external whenNotPaused {
    (
      bool inviteSenderVerified,
      bool inviteSenderArchived,
      bool inviteSenderIsMock
    ) = profileStatusById(inviterId);
    if (!inviteSenderVerified || inviteSenderArchived || inviteSenderIsMock) {
      revert InvalidSender();
    }
    _inviterProfileAuthorizedSender(inviterId, msg.sender);

    uint256 newID = _createProfile(msg.sender);
    profiles[newID].inviteInfo.invitedBy = inviterId;
    profiles[inviterId].inviteInfo.acceptedIds.push(newID);
  }
```
The function does not check if an address is compromised, thus allowing compromised addresses to create a profile.

a compromised account is associated with a profile already as can be observed by the code comments from the function below:
```solidity
 * - In case of account compromises, a profile can unregister an account and mark it as compromised.
 * - After registration, an address can never again be registered to another profile, even if it is archived.
 * - Unregistered accounts still remain associated with their original profile for historical tracking.
```
specifically i want to highlight this sentence ` Unregistered accounts still remain associated with their original profile for historical tracking.`
We can conlude from this that a unregistered account to a profile counts as association with that profile.

The problem occurs because an address that holds atleast 1 invite and is compromised can create a profile and thus be associated with 2 profiles at once. 

the function InviteAddress does check if an address is compromised by using the modifier `checkIfCompromised`
```solidity
  function inviteAddress(
    address invitee
  ) public whenNotPaused onlyNonZeroAddress(invitee) checkIfCompromised(invitee)
```
this can be bypassed if the address was invited prior to being set as compromised.

Thus since an address will be associated with 2 profiles, we can conclude the following invariant has been broken and thus the issue is a valid medium .

> One address may be associated with maximum one profile.

From sherlock docs we can confirm the issues validity by the following rules:

> The protocol team can use the README (and only the README) to define language that indicates the codebase's restrictions and/or expected functionality. Additionally, the protocol team can use only the following question to define the protocol's invariants/properties:

> What properties/invariants do you want to hold even if breaking them has a low/unknown impact?

> Issues that break the invariants from the above question, irrespective of whether the impact is low/unknown, will be assigned Medium severity. High severity will be applied only if the issue falls into the High severity category in the judging guidelines.

> Example: The README states "Admin can only call XYZ function once" but the code allows the Admin to call XYZ function twice; this is a valid Medium


### Internal pre-conditions

1. an address must have atleast 1 invite
2. the address must be set as compromised for a profile
3. the address must create a profile
4. the address is now associated with 2 profiles

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. an address holds atleast 1 invite
2. the address is set to compromised
3. the compromised address creates a profile
4. invariant is broken

### Impact

Protocol invariant is broken

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

do not allow compromised addresses to create profiles by adding the `checkIfCompromised` modifier to the `createProfile` function.
```solidity
function createProfile(uint256 inviterId) external whenNotPaused checkIfCompromised(msg.sender)
```
