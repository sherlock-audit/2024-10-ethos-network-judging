# AccessControl should have two step ownership transfer

### Summary

All contracts in scope inherits ```AccessControl``` contract which uses one step ownership transfer. This might be dangerous if the current contract owner transfers the ownership to address(0) or another address that doesnt have access to by accident. For example in contract ```EthosReview.sol``` there is function ```withdrawFunds``` that is using modifier ```onlyOwner``` and this function is the only way to withdraw the funds, if for some reason owner address is invalid or not accessible this might cause of locking the funds in that contract forever.



### Root Cause

[AccessControl::86](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/utils/AccessControl.sol#L86) is using one step ownership transfer also there is no check to prevent from transfering the ownership to ```address(0)```
