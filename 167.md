# Incorrect Address Removal Record in EthosProfile Contract

### Summary

Incorrect address storage in _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray will cause permanent and irreversible loss of removal records for Ethos users as the function stores wrong addresses in an append-only array, fundamentally breaking core auditability requirements of Ethos platform


### Root Cause

In EthosProfile.sol:_deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L591 the function incorrectly stores the last address from the array instead of the address being removed, corrupting the removal history:
```solidity
function _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray(
    uint256 index,
    address[] storage addresses,
    address[] storage removedAddresses
) private {
    address addr = addresses[addresses.length - 1];  // Gets LAST address instead of removed address
    addresses[index] = addr;                        
    removedAddresses.push(addr);                    // Incorrectly stores last address
    addresses.pop();
}
```

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User calls deleteAddressAtIndex(1) to remove address 0x123
2. Function gets last address 0x789 from array
3. Function overwrites address 0x123 at index 1 with 0x789
4. Function incorrectly adds 0x789 to removedAddresses instead of 0x123
5. True removal record of 0x123 is permanently lost

### Impact

The protocol suffers an irreversible breakdown of its core audit and record-keeping requirements:

1. Permanent and irreversible loss of accurate address removal history due to append-only array. Consequently, breakdown of audit capabilities as removed address records are incorrect and cannot be corrected
2. Potential security implications for future address verification processes as it becomes difficult to accurately track which addresses were legitimately removed
