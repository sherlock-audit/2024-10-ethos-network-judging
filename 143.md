# The inviter can DOS the invitee unnecessarily

### Summary

With the current design, an inviter can unintentionally dos an invitee by archiving their profile.

### Root Cause

In 'EthosProfile.sol' when a user invites another user , at the time of invite, there are explicit checks to check if the inviter's profile is verified and not archived. 

```Solidity
 function inviteAddress(
    address invitee
  ) public whenNotPaused onlyNonZeroAddress(invitee) checkIfCompromised(invitee) {
    (bool verified, bool archived, bool mock, uint256 profileId) = profileStatusByAddress(
      msg.sender
    );

    if (!verified || archived || mock) {
      revert InvalidSender();
    }

```

But again when the invitee tries to create the account using the invite,  during the status check of the inviter the archive check is done again.

```Solidity
  function createProfile(uint256 inviterId) external whenNotPaused {
    (
      bool inviteSenderVerified,
      bool inviteSenderArchived,
      bool inviteSenderIsMock
    ) = profileStatusById(inviterId);
    if (!inviteSenderVerified || inviteSenderArchived || inviteSenderIsMock) {
      revert InvalidSender();
    }
 ```

This can unnecessarily dos the invitee especially considering the archiving is done by the profile user itself and not the protocol and this shouldn't affect the invitee after the invite process is completed ,just because the inviter decides to archive their profile for some reason. This can also be exploited by a malicious inviter who can front run and  intentionally dos the user by archiving their profile whenever the invitee tries to create their account.


### Impact

Users who got successfull invites from verified profiles can be unnecessarily be denied a profile even when their invites are active.


### Mitigation

Remove the archive check of inviter from the createProfile() function:
```Solidity
    if (!inviteSenderVerified || inviteSenderIsMock) {
      revert InvalidSender();
    }
```
