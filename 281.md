# `EthosAttestation:: _keccakForCreateAttestation` Can Be Manipulated

### Summary

`EthosAttestation:: _keccakForCreateAttestation`  passes strings which are dynamic values to abi.encodePacked then the value is hashed with keccak256. Therefore, it can be easily manipulated. Below is the vulnerable code:

```solidity
  function _keccakForCreateAttestation(
    uint256 profileId,
    uint256 randValue,
    string calldata account,
    string calldata service,
    string calldata evidence
  ) private pure returns (bytes32) {
    return keccak256(abi.encodePacked(profileId, randValue, account, service, evidence));
  }
```

In this case `account`, `service`, and `evidence` are all strings thus dynamic values
The strings can be modified and still produce the same keccak256 hash.

### Root Cause

The vulnerable code is here: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos%2Fpackages%2Fcontracts%2Fcontracts%2FEthosAttestation.sol#L521-L529

Here is good explanation on the vulnerability.

### Internal pre-conditions

The `signature` has to valid but the signed message won't be as expected.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Attack path is as follows:

1. A message is signed with the following variables: profileId =2, randValue= 99, account =manager, service = whatever, evidence = something.
2.  Then the attestation is submitted with the following values: profileId =2, randValue= 99, account =m, service = anagerwhateversomethin, evidence = g. 
3. The attestation in step 2 will be verified successfully because the keccak256 hash will be the same as the original message.

### Impact

The data in the `EthosAttestation` contract can be easily corrupted.

### Mitigation

`EthosAttestation:: _keccakForCreateAttestation` do not use `abi.encodePacked` first hash each string with keccak256 then pass the hash of each string and hash them with the profileId , randValue etc.
