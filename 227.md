# Inconsistent permission check in `EthosReview::editReview` and `EthosReview::archiveReview`

### Summary

`EthosReview` allows profiles to add review other profiles in the protocol. There is permission check in `editReview`, `archiveReview` and `restoreReview`, however, the logic is inconsistent, which can cause certain issues in case of account compromise.

### Root Cause

Here in [`EthosReview::editReview`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosReview.sol#L261), we can see permission is checked via profile ID, meaning any addresses within the profile can edit review.
```solidity
  function editReview(
    uint256 reviewId,
    string calldata comment,
    string calldata metadata
  ) external whenNotPaused {
    Review storage review = reviews[reviewId];
    uint256 authorProfileId = _getEthosProfile().verifiedProfileIdForAddress(msg.sender);

    if (review.authorProfileId != authorProfileId) {
      revert UnauthorizedEdit(reviewId);
    }

    if (review.archived) {
      revert ReviewIsArchived(reviewId);
    }

    review.comment = comment;
    review.metadata = metadata;

    emit ReviewEdited(reviewId, msg.sender, review.subject);
  }
```

But in `archiveReview` and `restoreReview`, only review author can change archived state of the review:
```solidity
  function archiveReview(uint256 reviewId) external whenNotPaused {
    (bool exists, ) = targetExistsAndAllowedForId(reviewId);

    if (!exists) {
      revert ReviewNotFound(reviewId);
    }

    Review storage review = reviews[reviewId];

    if (review.archived) {
      revert ReviewIsArchived(reviewId);
    }

    if (review.author != msg.sender) {
      revert UnauthorizedArchiving(reviewId);
    }

    review.archived = true;

    emit ReviewArchived(reviewId, msg.sender, review.subject);
  }
```

There is an inconsistency here. For example, suppose both address A, B, and C are in the profile. And user used A to add review, if A is later compromised or deleted for any reason, the user which now holds addresses B and C will have no ways of archiving the review because it only acquires address A to do such operation.

### Impact

The inconsistency here can cause some review not being able to be archived/restored.

### Mitigation

Align the check with either only author or profile ID.
