# Anyone can deleteAddressAtIndex() after registerAddress() to a random profile taking over the account.

### Summary

The key of the issue lies in the fact that anyone can `registerAddress` to any profile Id they want provided it has enough `maxAddresses` left.

Then after registering the address, they can use this address to delete legitimate addresses that were owned by the original user of the profile id

[Deleting](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L415-L437), [Registering](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L406)

The profile can be made irrecoverable when the `maxNumberOfAddresses` is reached as well, causing the original user being unable to try the same tactic to recover his/her account.


### Root Cause

The root cause is that anyone can register an address attached to any profile ID, A mechanism where registering address, requires the approval of any existing addresses associated with the profile will solve this issue.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `maxNumberOfAddresses` of profile id is not reached yet allowing others to register addresses to the profile id.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker registers his own address to the target profile id
2. Attacker deletes every other address associated with the profile except his
3. If the `maxNumberOfAddresses` hasn't reached already, attacker exhausts this by registering more addresses.

### Impact

Full Account takeover of any target

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Have approval-based additions of new registered addresses to the profile id where existing addresses approve the new registering address to the profile id.
