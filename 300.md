# When a mock address is registered to another user, it loses its reviews, votes, and comments

### Summary

In Ethos, each user has a profile identified by a unique id, that can have multiple addresses. Profiles can receive reviews, votes, attestations, and comments.

If an address doesn't belong to a profile, a new **MOCK** profile is created. Mock profiles track reviews, votes and comments made without an associated subject `profileId`. Each address is mapped to a `profileId` in the `profileIdByAddress` mapping, including mock profiles. When someone leaves a review for a mock profile, the review is mapped to the mock's `profileId` in the `reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId` mapping.

Eventually, if the the owner of the address attached to the mock profile has a actual actual profile, they can register the address (attached to the mock profile) to their actual profile by calling the `registerAddress()` function in `EthosProfile.sol`. The function updates the `profileIdByAddress` mapping to point to the actual profileId and remove the address from the mock profile.

```solidity
373:  function registerAddress(address addressStr, uint256 profileId, uint256 randValue, bytes calldata signature)
        external
        whenNotPaused
        onlyNonZeroAddress(addressStr)
    {
       ...

        profiles[profileId].addresses.push(addressStr);
  ðŸ“Œ    profileIdByAddress[addressStr] = profileId;

        ...
    }
```

[_EthosProfile.sol#404_](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L404)

Afterward, when we check the `profileId` for the address, it will return a `profileId` different from the mock profile's. This is the intended behavior, as the address is now part of the actual profile.

**The problem arises** in the `EthosReview.sol` contract, where `reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId` is not updated when the address is registered to the actual profile. This means that the review remains associated with the mock profile but not with the address, causing `reviewIdsBySubjectAddress()` to not functio as expected, leading to lost reviews.

```solidity
  97:  function addReview(uint256 subjectProfileId, uint256 rating, string calldata review, uint256 randValue, bytes calldata signature)
        external
        whenNotPaused
        onlyNonZeroProfileId(subjectProfileId)
    {
        ...
  ðŸ“Œ    reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId[subjectProfileId].push(reviewId);
        ...
    }
```

Same vulnerability also exists in the `EthosDiscussion.sol` and `EthosVotes` contracts, where `replies[ethosProfile][targetId]` and `votesGeneralByContractByTargetId[ethosProfile][targetId]` are also not updated when the address is registered to an actual profile.

This is important, beacuse reviews, discussions and votes are used for off-chain reputation score calculation. Losing them can lead to a loss of reputation.

### Root Cause

The following mappings are not updated when an address of a mock profile is registered to an actual profile:

- `reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId[subjectProfileId]`@`EthosReview.sol`
- `replies[ethosProfile][targetId]`@`EthosDiscussion.sol`
- `votesGeneralByContractByTargetId[targetContract][targetId]` @ `EthosVote.sol`

### Internal pre-conditions

- Address is attached to a mock profile.
- Address is registered as a secondary address to an actual profile.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path


Scenario:

- **0x123** is an address with a mock profile.
- **0x456** is an address with an actual profile.
- Alice owns both addresses

---

1. Bob leaves a review for **0x123**.
2. Bob also votes for **0x123**.
3. Alice registers **0x123** to her actual profile.
4. Bob checks his reviews and votes for **0x123** and gets 0 results.

### Impact

- `reviewIdsBySubjectAddress()` in `EthosReview.sol`
- `hasVotedFor()` and `votesInRangeFor()` in `EthosVote.sol`
- `directRepliesInRange()` and `addReply()` in `EthosDiscussion.sol`

will not return all reviews, votes, and comments associated with the address _(only those specifically written for the verified profile before the registration)_.

Users will lose reviews and discussions associated with their mock profile upon registering the address to an actual profile, which will lead to incorrect off-chain reputation score calculations.

### PoC

Place the following code in `address.register.test.ts`:

```typescript
// eslint-disable-next-line jest/no-focused-tests
it.only('should lose reviews when a mock profileâ€™s address is registered to another user', async () => {
  const ethosReview: EthosReview = deployer.ethosReview.contract;
  const userAAddress2 = await deployer.newWallet();

  await userB.review({ address: userAAddress2.address });
  // Verify the review was created
  const userAAddress2ProfileId = await ethosProfile.profileIdByAddress(userAAddress2.address);
  const reviews = await ethosReview.reviewsBySubjectInRange(userAAddress2ProfileId, 0, 10);
  // userAAddress2 should own 1 review
  expect(reviews.length).to.equal(1);
  expect(reviews[0][3]).to.equal(userAAddress2.address); // Review.subject

  // at this point userAAddress2 should be mapped to a mock profile
  const userAAddress2Status = await ethosProfile.profileStatusById(userAAddress2ProfileId);
  expect(userAAddress2Status[2]).to.equal(true); // Mock == true
  expect(userAAddress2Status[0]).to.equal(false); // Verified == false

  // Register userAAddress2 to userA
  await registerAddress(userA, userAAddress2.address);

  // verify userAAddress2 is now part of userA's profile
  const userAAddresses = await ethosProfile.addressesForProfile(userA.profileId);
  expect(userAAddresses.length).to.equal(2);
  expect(userAAddresses[0]).to.equal(userA.signer.address);
  expect(userAAddresses[1]).to.equal(userAAddress2.address);

  const userAAddress2ProfileIdNEW = await ethosProfile.profileIdByAddress(userAAddress2.address);
  // verify the review is no longer associated with userAAddress2
  const reviewsAfterRegistration = await ethosReview.reviewsBySubjectInRange(
    userAAddress2ProfileIdNEW,
    0,
    10,
  );

  // review still exists but is no longer associated with userAAddress2 as
  // it is mapped to the old profileId of userAAddress2 and doesn't get updated
  expect(reviewsAfterRegistration.length).to.equal(0);
});
```

</details>

### Mitigation


Update the `profileId` in the `reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId`, `votesGeneralByContractByTargetId` and `replies` mappings when the address is registered to an actual profile using `registerAddress()`.

âš  Be cautious when updating these mappings, as a user may write a review for a mock profile before registering the address to their actual profile, which would cause the user to review themselves.
