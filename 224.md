# Mock Attestation is Able to Avoid Good/Bad Review Impact, Resulting in Attestation Reputation Reset

**Description**

When a review author [leaves a review](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosReview.sol#L164-L219) for an attestation that does not yet exist, it [creates a mock profile for that attestation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosReview.sol#L237-L243). 

If most users leave negative reviews for this mock attestation, it will harm the attestation's reputation and credibility score, causing users to lose trust in it.

Conversely, if most users leave positive reviews, this will enhance the mock attestation’s reputation and credibility.

The issue arises when the valid owner of the mock attestation, later [creates the attestation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L176-L260) for the same `attestationHash` that users have written reviews for.

During the attestation creation process, a [new profile ID is assigned](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L250) to the attestation. Consequently, when querying the `EthosReview::reviewsByAttestationHashInRange()` or `EthosReview::reviewIdsBySubjectAttestationHash()` functions with this `attestationHash`, no reviews are returned, effectively allowing the mock profile to avoid any previously written good or bad reviews and resetting its reputation and credibility to a neutral state.

**Impact**

Once a mock attestation with negative reviews is reset in this way, any damage to its reputation is nullified, allowing it to regain a neutral or "clean" reputation, despite past negative reviews.

Conversely, if a mock attestation with a positive reputation and favorable reviews is reset, it loses all gained credibility, impacting trust from users.

This compromises the reliability of attestation reputations, allowing legitimate reviews (both positive and negative) to be bypassed, which may mislead users and erode trust in the Ethos Network’s reputation system.

**Recommended Mitigation**

* To address this, add a mapping in `EthosReview` to track attestation reviews by `attestationHash`:

```diff
+   mapping (bytes32 attestationHash => uint256[] reviewIds) public reviewIdsByAttestationHash;
```

* Refactor `addReview()` so that whenever a new review is added for an attestation, the review ID is added to the list of reviews associated with that `attestationHash`.

* Additionally, refactor `editReview()` to identify a review by `attestationHash`, allowing the review author to edit it.

* Also, refactor the `archiveReview()` and `restoreReview()` functions to be able to identify reviews by `attestationHash` and allow archiving and unarchiving of a review.

Lastly, add getter functions that take an `attestationHash` and returns all or specific reviews associated with that hash.
