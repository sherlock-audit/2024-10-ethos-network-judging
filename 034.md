# Users can not register an address to his profile.

### Summary

A user can register multiple addresses to his profile.
If the address has already been reviewed, it is tied to a mock profile id.
Therefore, the registration of the address will be reverted.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L394

### Root Cause

When an address is reviewed, it is tied to a mock profile id in the following `EthosProfile.incrementProfileCount()` function.
```solidity
  function incrementProfileCount(
    bool isAttestation,
    address subject,
    bytes32 attestation
  ) external whenNotPaused returns (uint256 profileId) {
    ...SKIP...
    profileId = profileCount;
    if (isAttestation) {
      profileIdByAttestation[attestation] = profileId;
    } else {
305:  profileIdByAddress[subject] = profileId;
    }
    ...SKIP...
  }
```
Next, `EthosProfile.registerAddress()` function is the following.
```solidity
  function registerAddress(
    address addressStr,
    uint256 profileId,
    uint256 randValue,
    bytes calldata signature
  ) external whenNotPaused onlyNonZeroAddress(addressStr) {
    ...SKIP...
    (bool addressAlreadyRegistered, , , uint256 registeredProfileId) = profileStatusByAddress(
      addressStr
    );
394:if (addressAlreadyRegistered && registeredProfileId != profileId) {
      revert ProfileExistsForAddress(addressStr);
    }
    ...SKIP...
```
As can be seen, if `addressStr` has already been reviewed, since `addressAlreadyRegistered = true` and `registeredProfileId != profileId` in L394, it will be reverted.


### Internal pre-conditions

- A user has two addresses.
- One of the user's address is already reviewed by reviewer.


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A user has two address: 'addr1` and `addr2`.
2. `addr2` has already been reviewed and is tied to a mock profile id.
3. The user create profile with `addr1`.
4. The user call `registerAddress` to register `addr2` to his own profile.
5. The function call is reverted with `ProfileExistsForAddress` error in `L395`.


### Impact

Breaks core contract functionality because users can't register multiple addresses to his profile.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

If an address to register is tied to a mock profile, allow the address to be registered.
