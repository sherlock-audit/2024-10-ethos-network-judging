# User will not be able to add reply to the contract EthosDiscussion

### Summary

The `addReply` function in EthosDiscussion has a special case towards replies directed towards the contract itself. 

However the condition is never fulfilled and replies are never possible when the target contract is the ethosDiscussion contract.

### Root Cause

There is a check
```solidity

    if (isTargetThisContract) {
@>      if (replies[targetId].createdAt == 0) {
        revert TargetNotFound(targetContract, targetId);
      }
    } else {
      _checkIfTargetExistsAndAllowed(targetContract, targetId);
    }
```

[in EthosDiscussion contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosDiscussion.sol#L118)

However the thing is that replies[] will never have an entry towards target contract for a target entry as even the first entry will have a check to see whether its referencing some other reply. This isn't the case for the first ever reply and the call will fail completely preventing any sort of reply to the `EthosDiscussion` target contract

as later seen in the same `addReply` function

```solidity
 replies[_replyCount] = Reply(
      !isTargetThisContract,
      targetContract,
      authorID,
      _replyCount,
      targetId,
      block.timestamp,
      0,
      content,
      metadata
    );
..}
```
