# Lack of delete profile function restricts a user to start a new profile from scratch.

### Summary

In 'EthosProfile.sol' , a lack of delete profile function prevents a user from starting a new profile from scratch.

### Root Cause

In the Ethos documentation its stated that if a user's reputation is completely destroyed , the user can always start a new profile "_Ethos is pseudonymous, it is always possible to start a new profile from scratch._" [Under Philosophy header, the last paragraph ](https://whitepaper.ethos.network/ethos-mechanisms/vouch) 
However with the current implementation, its not possible without a proper delete profile function. Even if the user deletes the addresses from the previous profile, wont be able to create a new profile as it will always revert as every address and attestations will still be associated with the previous profile itself.

```Solidity
  function _createProfile(address user) internal returns (uint256 profileId) {
    (bool verified, , bool mock, uint256 existingProfileId) = profileStatusByAddress(user);
    if (verified) {
      revert ProfileExists(existingProfileId);
    } else if (mock) {
      profileId = existingProfileId;
    } else {
      profileId = profileCount;
      profileCount++;
    }

    profileIdByAddress[user] = profileId;
    profiles[profileId].profileId = profileId;
    profiles[profileId].createdAt = block.timestamp;
    profiles[profileId].inviteInfo.available = defaultNumberOfInvites;
    profiles[profileId].addresses.push(user);

    emit ProfileCreated(profileId, user);
    return profileId;
  }
```

```Solidity
function registerAddress(
    address addressStr,
    uint256 profileId,
    uint256 randValue,
    bytes calldata signature
  ) external whenNotPaused onlyNonZeroAddress(addressStr) {
    (bool verified, bool archived, bool mock) = profileStatusById(profileId);
    if (!verified) {
      revert ProfileNotFound(profileId);
    }
    if (archived || mock) {
      revert ProfileAccess(profileId, "Profile is archived");
    }
    // you may restore your own previously deleted address,
    // but you cannot register an address that has been deleted by another user
    if (profileIdByAddress[addressStr] != profileId && isAddressCompromised[addressStr]) {
      revert AddressCompromised(addressStr);
    }
    (bool addressAlreadyRegistered, , , uint256 registeredProfileId) = profileStatusByAddress(
      addressStr
    );
    if (addressAlreadyRegistered && registeredProfileId != profileId) {
      revert ProfileExistsForAddress(addressStr);
    }

    validateAndSaveSignature(
      _keccakForRegisterAddress(addressStr, profileId, randValue),
      signature
    );

    profiles[profileId].addresses.push(addressStr);
    profileIdByAddress[addressStr] = profileId;

    checkMaxAddresses(profileId);

    emit AddressClaim(profileId, addressStr, AddressClaimStatus.Claimed);
  }
```

### Impact

The users who lost their reputation / credibility will not be able to start a new profile


### Mitigation

Implement a proper deleteProfile() function so that users can delete their previous profiles and start a new one from scratch.
