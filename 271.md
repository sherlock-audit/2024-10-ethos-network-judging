# Deleted(Compromised) addresses can still uninvite users.

### Summary

`uninviteUser()` does not check if the caller has been labelled as compromised, hence an address deleted from a profile would still pass all the present checks in the function and successfully uninvite a user.

### Root Cause

- `uninviteUser()` is under-constrained https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L258-L280

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `deletedAddress`(compromised address) has to have been registered to the profile then deleted 
2. the `unInvite` address needs to have been invited.
3. Compromised addresses can only uninvite, invitees of the same profile.

### External pre-conditions

1.  Invitee has not accepted the invitation yet.

### Attack Path

1. Compromised/deleted address calls `uninviteUser()`

### Impact

- Ethos suffers a drop in user adoption rate of their protocol.
