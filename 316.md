# The incorrect address is removed in _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray()

### Summary

function `_deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray` - is used to delete the address of the user that is associated with that current profile id at that index.

And therefore this function is supposed to - remove that particular index of arrays(addresses) from the `addresses` array.

And at the same time that same particular address of index of arrays(addresses) is supposed to be added in `removedAddresses` array.

But here the last index is added in removedAddresses array -> `removedAddresses.push(addr);` which is completely wrong.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L591

Whenever a user deletes an address at an index through `deleteAddressAtIndex()` it would delete wrong address.

```solidity
function deleteAddressAtIndex(uint256 addressIndex) external whenNotPaused {
    uint256 profileId = profileIdByAddress[msg.sender];
    (bool verified, bool archived, bool mock) = profileStatusById(profileId);
    if (!verified) {
      revert ProfileNotFoundForAddress(msg.sender);
    }
    if (archived || mock) {
      revert ProfileAccess(profileId, "Profile is archived");
    }

    address[] storage addresses = profiles[profileId].addresses;
    address[] storage removedAddresses = profiles[profileId].removedAddresses;
    if (addresses.length <= addressIndex) {
      revert InvalidIndex();
    }

    address addressStr = addresses[addressIndex];
    isAddressCompromised[addressStr] = true;
    _addressShouldDifferFromSender(addressStr);

@>  _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray(addressIndex, addresses, removedAddresses);

    emit AddressClaim(profileId, addressStr, AddressClaimStatus.Unclaimed);
  }
```

Then in function `_deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray` is getting executed - 

```solidity
  function _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray(
    uint256 index,
    address[] storage addresses,
    address[] storage removedAddresses
  ) private {
@>    address addr = addresses[addresses.length - 1];
    addresses[index] = addr;
@>    removedAddresses.push(addr);
    addresses.pop();
  }
  ```
  
  We can clearly see that, here the last index is added in removedAddresses array -> `removedAddresses.push(addr);` which is wrong and instead `index` that was passed was supposed to be push into this `removedAddresses` array.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

1) The incorrect address is removed in _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray() 

2) If someone has two addresses, one is compromised, but the other one is still valid. If removal of the wrong address is happening, the other account that was supposed to be removed index, is now has control over the account. The attacker can archive the profile and front-run any attempt to un-archive it, keeping the profile permanently out of the hands of the valid owner.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement `_deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray` function like this -

```solidity
  function _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray(
    uint256 index,
    address[] storage addresses,
    address[] storage removedAddresses
  ) private {
    address addr = addresses[addresses.length - 1];
@>  removedAddresses.push(addresses[index]);
@>  addresses[index] = addr;
    addresses.pop();
  }
```
