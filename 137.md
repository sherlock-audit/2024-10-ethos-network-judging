# `AccessControl` Cannot Be Upgraded

### Summary

`AccessControl` cannot be upgraded as it is missing the authorize upgrade method.

As here, Openzeppelin says about `Initializable` which is inherited by `SignatureControl`\
[https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol#L7](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol#L7)

```solidity
/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy
 **/
```

### Impact

It can not be upgraded, but other contracts like `EthosProfile`, `EthosAttestation` can be upgraded.

### PoC

`AccessControl` inherit from `SignatureControl`.\
However, the `SignatureControl` forget to inherit Openzepplin's `UUPSUpgradeable` contract.\
Therefore, it is missing the authorize upgrade method, and the contract cannot be upgraded.

```solidity
abstract contract SignatureControl is Initializable {
  address public expectedSigner;
  address public signatureVerifier;

  mapping(bytes => bool) public signatureUsed;

  error SignatureWasUsed();
  error InvalidSignature();
  error ZeroAddress();
  
  ...OTHER_CODES...
}
```

```solidity
abstract contract AccessControl is IPausable, Pausable, AccessControlEnumerable, SignatureControl {
  bytes32 public constant OWNER_ROLE = keccak256("OWNER_ROLE");
  bytes32 public constant ADMIN_ROLE = keccak256("ADMIN_ROLE");

  IContractAddressManager public contractAddressManager;

  ...OTHER_CODES...
}
```

### Mitigation

It is recommended to Inherit Openzepplin's `UUPSUpgradeable` contract and implement the missing authorize upgrade method.

```diff
- abstract contract SignatureControl is Initializable {
+ abstract contract SignatureControl is Initializable, UUPSUpgradeable {
    address public expectedSigner;
    address public signatureVerifier;

    mapping(bytes => bool) public signatureUsed;

    error SignatureWasUsed();
    error InvalidSignature();
    error ZeroAddress();

+   function _authorizeUpgrade(
+       address newImplementation
+   ) internal override onlyOwner onlyNonZeroAddress(newImplementation) {
+       // Intentionally left blank to ensure onlyOwner and zeroCheck modifiers run
+      // Implement onlyOwner, onlyNonZeroAddress or necessary modifier to it.
+    }
    
    ...OTHER_CODES...
}
```
