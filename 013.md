# Hash collision vulnerability in ethos attestation validation enables forged attestations

### Summary

The Ethos protocol’s [`createAttestation` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L191-L200) is vulnerable to a hash collision exploit, which allows a malicious user to create false attestations. Because the function uses `abi.encodePacked()` for non-fixed-size data (such as `account`, `service`, and `evidence` strings) when generating the signature hash, a user can craft inputs that produce the same hash as legitimate data signed by the Ethos app. This permits the user to substitute portions of the attestation, leading to forged attestations without detection.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability arises because `abi.encodePacked()` is used for encoding the `account`, `service`, and `evidence` parameters, which are non-fixed-size string data. This encoding can lead to hash collisions when different strings concatenate into identical byte sequences, especially if malicious users manipulate input data to generate the same hash as genuine, Ethos-signed attestations.

In the code below, `abi.encodePacked()` creates potential collisions for these non-fixed-size parameters:

```solidity
validateAndSaveSignature(
  _keccakForCreateAttestation(
    profileId,
    randValue,
    attestationDetails.account, // <-- Non-fixed-size, vulnerable to collision
    attestationDetails.service, // <-- Non-fixed-size, vulnerable to collision
    evidence                     // <-- Non-fixed-size, vulnerable to collision
  ),
  signature
);
```

The signature function:

```solidity
function _keccakForCreateAttestation(
  uint256 profileId,
  uint256 randValue,
  string calldata account,
  string calldata service,
  string calldata evidence
) private pure returns (bytes32) {
  return keccak256(abi.encodePacked(profileId, randValue, account, service, evidence));
}
```

By exploiting this function’s use of non-fixed-size data, attackers can produce the same hash for different inputs, allowing unauthorized attestations.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A legitimate attestation is created and signed by Ethos with the following inputs (as an example):
   - `account = "user1"`
   - `service = "www.x.com"`
   - `evidence = "https://x.com/BaltoBebek/status/1850636429430534287"`
2. The attacker obtains the signed data and creates a new attestation request, modifying the values as follows:
   - `account = "user1www."`
   - `service = "x.com"`
   - `evidence = "https://x.com/BaltoBebek/status/1850636429430534287"`
3. Due to the use of `abi.encodePacked()`, these inputs produce the same hash, allowing the malicious data to pass verification using the Ethos app’s valid signature.
4. The attacker submits the modified attestation, creating a valid-looking but falsified attestation on the Ethos platform.

### Impact

This vulnerability undermines the integrity of Ethos attestations by allowing falsified data to appear as if it were signed by the Ethos app. Malicious actors can therefore create attestations with altered information, eroding trust in Ethos’s ability to provide secure and verifiable attestations, and potentially leading to significant misuse of attestations across integrated applications or services.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To only use fixed size data and avoid this vulnerability, each unfixed data should be hash before abi.encode it.
Replace the `_keccakForCreateAttestation` function by this:
```solidity
  function _keccakForCreateAttestation(
    uint256 profileId,
    uint256 randValue,
    string calldata account,
    string calldata service,
    string calldata evidence
  ) private pure returns (bytes32) {
    return keccak256(abi.encode(profileId, randValue, keccak256(account), keccak256(service), keccak256(evidence)));
  }
```
