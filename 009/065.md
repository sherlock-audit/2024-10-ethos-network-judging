# `abi.encodePacked` Allows Hash Collision

### Summary

According to the solidity documentation:
<https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/abi-spec.html?highlight=collisions#non-standard-packed-mode>
\> If we use `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(a, b))` and both `a` and `b` are dynamic types, it is easy to craft collisions in the hash value by moving parts of `a` into `b` and vice-versa. More specifically, `abi.encodePacked("a", "bc") == abi.encodePacked("ab", "c")`.


### Root Cause

As we can see both service and account are dynamic types that can be bypassed by using different values which can be crafted into a same value , thus failing for a attestation since the hash produced by `_keccakForCreateAttestation` will be same and thus `getServiceAndAccountHash` will also be same for two different inputs such as `abi.encodePacked("a", "bc") == abi.encodePacked("ab", "c")`.
Allowing two different users to have same hash during their attestation
