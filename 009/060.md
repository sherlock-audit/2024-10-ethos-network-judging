# removedAddresses[] will contain duplicate addresses, thus making the total number of addresses appear bigger than it should

### Summary

`deleteAddressAtIndex()` is intended to remove a specified address from a profile and to add it to the profile's array of `removedAddresses[]` which is normal processing of logic, BUT...

If we re-register the address in [registerAddress()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L373), we **do not remove** the address from the `profiles[profileId].removedAddresses;`.

This is problematic because we use the length of the array in `checkMaxAddresses()` for checking if the user has the ability to add a new address, but if.. 
Let's say the address limit is 10 and we have exactly 10 addresses, if I remove one of the addresses and decide to re-register it,
 **it will revert**, because it will contain the **same address in both** the `addresses[]` of the profile and the `removedAddresses[]` of the same profile, thus giving the illusion that we have more addresses in total than we actually have, **preventing us** from re-registering the removed address.

### Root Cause

The root cause is that we **do not remove** the address from the `removedAddresses[]` in the process of re-registering it in `registerAddress()`, which will cause trouble in the scenario that I've specified above.

### Internal pre-conditions

We should be on the border of `maxAddresses()`, so that when we call `registerAddress()` in order to re-register the address, 
the revert will occur.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Alice has 10 addresses in total - 9 active and one removed (the `maxAddresses()` is 10 for the purpose of the example)
2. Alice then decides to re-register her removed address by calling `registerAddress()`
3. `registerAddress()` will revert due to the calculation of both removed and active addresses and she won't be able to re-register her address

### Impact

In some scenarios, users may not be able to re-register their removed address, even though the actual number of total addresses remains the same.
