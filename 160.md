# Archived items are still public in the network

### Summary

In Ethos Social Network, users have an ability to archive their review, reply or profile. But in the current system design, this intended behaviour is not correctly implemented.

### Root Cause

First of all, if something in the network is archived by an user, then it should be invisible to every other user in the social network. Currently, many state variable is defined as public in the network and this situation makes the archiving system pointless. 

For instance [reviews](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosReview.sol#L84) are defined as follows:
```solidity
  mapping(uint256 => Review) public reviews; // @audit it should be private
```
[Profiles](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L57) are correctly defined as private:
```solidity
  mapping(uint256 => Profile) private profiles;
```
But in [attestation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L68C1-L69C1), it's defined as public again.
```solidity
  mapping(uint256 => bytes32[]) public attestationHashesByProfileId;
```

Also, there are some getter functions such as:

```solidity
  function reviewsByAuthorInRange(
    uint256 authorProfileId,
    uint256 fromIdx,
    uint256 maxLength
  ) external view returns (Review[] memory result) {
    uint256[] memory reviewIds = reviewIdsByAuthorProfileId[authorProfileId];
    return _reviewsInRange(maxLength, fromIdx, reviewIds);
  }
```

This function should check the caller is profile owner or not because if it's not the owner, it shouldn't return archived contents.

### Impact

Medium - This is not expressed as intended design choice of the protocol. Archive system doesn't work as it should be. Those informations ( archived contents ) should be available only for the owner of the profile.

> Please discuss any design choices you made.

> The consequences of these contracts being hacked should never result in users losing money. These contracts explicitly should not ever allow the user to maintain funds (escrow, tokens, or other balances). We consider these "non-financial" smart contracts; they are "social" only.

> The Review contract does have the ability to set a price, but payments are only withdrawable by the contract owner, and thus doesn't represent a loss of user funds (they've already paid).

### Mitigation

The mapping state variables should be private in the first place and then for every getter function, the protocol needs user validation. If a content is archived, only the profile owner should be able to see it.
