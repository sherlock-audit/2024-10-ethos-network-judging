# Simultaneous ERC20 and native ETH payments cause unexpected reverts, user confusion, and potential gas loss

### Summary

In `EthosReview.sol`, the `_handlePayment` function lacks validation to prevent users from sending both ERC20 tokens and native ETH at the same time. If both payment methods are provided, the function reverts due to a `WrongPaymentAmount` error. This creates a poor user experience, as users may unintentionally incur gas costs from reverted transactions, especially when using WETH on the Base chain.

### Root Cause

In [EthosReview.sol: 202](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosReview.sol#L202), `_handlePayment` does not validate that only one payment type (either ERC20 tokens or native ETH) is provided, allowing both payment types to be sent simultaneously, leading to unexpected reverts.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The paymentToken is set to an ERC20 address (e.g., WETH on Base).
2. `msg.value` is greater than 0, indicating that native ETH is also being sent.

### External pre-conditions

The user attempts to send both native ETH and an ERC20 token in the same transaction.

### Attack Path

1. A user sends both native ETH and an ERC20 token (e.g., WETH) to the `_handlePayment` function.
2. The function reverts due to the `WrongPaymentAmount` error.
3. This revert leads to unexpected transaction failures and gas fees, especially if users are unaware of the one-payment-type-only requirement.


### Impact

Users experience unnecessary transaction reverts and incur gas fees for failed transactions. The lack of clarity may lead to user confusion and reduce trust in the contractâ€™s payment system.

### PoC

### Mitigation

To prevent users from sending both ERC20 tokens and native ETH simultaneously, and to ensure only one payment method is used, the following updates are recommended:

1. Restrict to a Single Payment Type: Update _handlePayment to validate that only one payment type is allowed per transaction (either ERC20 or native ETH). This prevents cases where users might unintentionally send both.

2. Verify Allowance for ERC20 Payments: Enhance security by adding a check to confirm the ERC20 allowance is at least equal to the required payment amount. This ensures the user has authorized sufficient funds for the transaction.
