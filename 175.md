# Missing whenNotPaused Modifier in uninviteUser Function

###  Summary
The uninviteUser function in the contract is missing a whenNotPaused modifier. This oversight allows users to interact with the function even when the contract is paused, which should not be the intended behavior, as paused states are typically used to suspend critical functions for maintenance or during emergency situations.
### Vulnerabilities Details
The uninviteUser function currently lacks a whenNotPaused modifier. This omission allows users to execute the function and modify the state of invites (such as removing pending invites and restoring available invites) even when the contract is paused. Pausing a contract usually indicates that the contract’s functionality is temporarily restricted, either for upgrades, emergency responses, or maintenance. By allowing uninviteUser to be callable while the contract is paused, it circumvents these restrictions and can lead to unintended consequences, potentially compromising the contract’s integrity.
### Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L258-L280
```
// @audit-issue : Missing whenNotPaused
  function uninviteUser(address user) external onlyNonZeroAddress(user) {
    uint256 id = profileIdByAddress[msg.sender];
    Profile storage inviter = profiles[id];

    uint256 index = sentInviteIndexByProfileIdAndAddress[id][user];
    if (index >= inviter.inviteInfo.sent.length || inviter.inviteInfo.sent[index] != user) {
      revert AddressNotInvited();
    }

    // Move the last element to the removed position
    uint256 lastIndex = inviter.inviteInfo.sent.length - 1;
    address lastAddress = inviter.inviteInfo.sent[lastIndex];
    inviter.inviteInfo.sent[index] = lastAddress;
    sentInviteIndexByProfileIdAndAddress[id][lastAddress] = index;

    // Remove the last element
    inviter.inviteInfo.sent.pop();
    delete sentInviteIndexByProfileIdAndAddress[id][user];

    inviter.inviteInfo.available++;
    sentAt[id][user] = 0;
    emit Uninvited(id, msg.sender, inviter.inviteInfo.available, user);
  }
```
### Impact
If the contract administrator intends to pause the contract to prevent invite modifications temporarily, the missing whenNotPaused modifier allows users to continue modifying invite states. This could disrupt ongoing maintenance or emergency processes, potentially leaving the contract vulnerable to further issues or allowing users to bypass intended security restrictions during the paused state.
### Recommendation
Add the whenNotPaused modifier to the uninviteUser function to prevent it from being callable when the contract is paused. This modification ensures that users cannot modify invite-related data during a paused state, aligning with the intended restrictions and improving the contract's resilience to emergency or maintenance scenarios.
