# Inadequate Token Pricing Differentiation in _handlePayment() Allows Exploitation of Payment Processing

### Summary

as we know that the protocole will interact with :
-wETH 
-**any other ERC20** that follows exactly the standard (eg. 18 decimals).
The lack of differentiation in token pricing in the `_handlePayment()` function will cause incorrect payment processing for users, as an attacker can exploit uniform pricing across different tokens.

### Root Cause

In `EthosReview.sol`, the `_handlePayment()` function does not adequately differentiate between token prices, leading to potential exploitation.
```solidity
function _handlePayment(address paymentToken) private onlyValidPaymentToken(paymentToken) {
    uint256 price = reviewPrice[paymentToken].price;

    if (price > 0) {
      if (paymentToken == address(0)) {
      // USING THE PRICE AS A CHECK VALUE
        if (msg.value != price) {
          revert WrongPaymentAmount(paymentToken, msg.value);
        }
      } else {
        if (msg.value > 0) {
          revert WrongPaymentAmount(address(0), msg.value);
        }
// THE SAME PRICE VALUE IS SENT HERE 
        IERC20(paymentToken).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), price);
      }
    }
  }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

- Admin sets the same price for multiple tokens using `setReviewPrice()`.
- A user attempts to pay with a token priced differently than Ether.


### External pre-conditions

- The `wETH` token and other ERC20 tokens are used for payments.
- Token prices fluctuate or differ in value compared to Ether.


### Attack Path

1. Admin configures the same price for Ether and an ERC20 token.
2. User pays with the cheaper token, bypassing the intended price for Ether.

### Impact

The protocol suffers from incorrect payment validation, potentially leading to financial discrepancies. Users might exploit this to pay less than intended.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement distinct pricing logic for each token type, ensuring that the _handlePayment() function checks and enforces the correct price for each token.
