# Deleted addresses can reregister themselves and can also register other addresses

### Summary

`registerAddress()` does not implement a check against compromised addresses appropriately, therefore they can call and successfully execute the function on their address. The only relatively close check for a compromised address in `registerAddress()` is 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L386-L390
This is because users are intended to still be able to reregister deleted addresses but the logic doesn't have enough constraint to stop deleted/compromised wallets from reregistering themselves to the profile. The check above fails to stop this because `profileIdByAddress[addressStr] != profileId` is `false` since deleted addresses are only removed from the associated profile's `addresses` array but not deleted from `profileIdByAddress` struct.

### Root Cause

- The choice to allow users reregister deleted addresses opened up a gateway for compromised addresses to reregister themselves hence a profile owner can't ever stop an attacker who has compromised a previously registered address, since s/he can always just reregister himself back.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The address has to have been previously registered 

### External pre-conditions

1. The address needs to be compromised by an attacker 

### Attack Path

1. Compromised wallet calls `registerAddress()` with the appropriate arguments.

### Impact

- Permanent compromise of a profile.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Add additional checks such as: 
```solidity
if ( msg.sender == addressStr) {
     revert();
}
```
