# If an address of profile is compromised, attacker can steal the profile directly

### Summary

In Ethos Social Network, if an address is compromised, the user can remove this address from the account using remove feature. But attacker can also use that feature to steal the account.

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue is system design of the protocol. There is no validation such as two-step verification and address removal can be directly executed in the system.

```solidity
  function deleteAddressAtIndex(uint256 addressIndex) external whenNotPaused {
    uint256 profileId = profileIdByAddress[msg.sender];
    (bool verified, bool archived, bool mock) = profileStatusById(profileId);
    if (!verified) {
      revert ProfileNotFoundForAddress(msg.sender);
    }
    if (archived || mock) {
      revert ProfileAccess(profileId, "Profile is archived");
    }

    address[] storage addresses = profiles[profileId].addresses;
    address[] storage removedAddresses = profiles[profileId].removedAddresses;
    if (addresses.length <= addressIndex) {
      revert InvalidIndex();
    }

    address addressStr = addresses[addressIndex];
    isAddressCompromised[addressStr] = true;
    _addressShouldDifferFromSender(addressStr);

    _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray(addressIndex, addresses, removedAddresses);

    emit AddressClaim(profileId, addressStr, AddressClaimStatus.Unclaimed);
  }
```
The attacker can remove all the other addresses and register new address to the contract. Those are problematic actions because they are directly executed without timelock or any other protection mechanism. 

### External pre-conditions

- An address should be compromised

### Attack Path

1. In Alice profile there are 3 addresses 0x1, 0x2, 0x3
2. 0x1 is compromised
3. Attacker removed 0x2 and 0x3 using 0x1
4. Attacker registered 0x4 which is attacker's address
5. Registration needs signature from Ethos App, but Ethos App creates that signature for all the valid addresses in the protocol. You can investigate it using the demo app.
6. Attacker removed 0x1 from the profile
7. Now, the only owner of the account is 0x4 which is attacker's address

### Impact

High - If the address is compromised, there is no way to save the profile from the attacker. Attacker can easily steal the account using the attack vector above.

### Mitigation

Implementing a timelock for safe executions or 2-step verification system can solve the problem.
