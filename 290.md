# self review is possible if a user review an attestation before claiming it .

### Summary

in EthosReview contract, a user can add a review on an attestation by calling `addReview()` with `subject == address(0)` along with the account and service details included in `attestationDetails` . However, to ensure that the user is not reviewing himself there is [a check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosReview.sol#L539-L541) that ` the profile linked to this attestation != the profile of the user submitted the review ` if so the call will revert .
The issue is that a user can review his own attestation before creating it (or claiming it), so [`profileId ` retrieved from EthosProfile](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosReview.sol#L539) will be zero and the check will pass successfully . The user can after that claim his attestation and benefit from the positive reviews he added to himself and
