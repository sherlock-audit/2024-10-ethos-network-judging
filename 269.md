# `Bulk Invites` May Cause Transaction Reverts in `EthosProfile` Contract

### Summary

The current implementation of the `bulkInviteAddresses` function in the `EthosProfile` contract will cause a complete transaction revert if any single invite fails, affecting all subsequent invites in the list.

### Root Cause

In `EthosProfile.sol`, the `bulkInviteAddresses` function calls the `inviteAddress` function in a loop without handling reverts for individual invites. If an invite fails (e.g., due to the invitee being a compromised address or an invalid sender), the entire transaction is reverted, preventing successful invites from being processed.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The caller must have an active profile.
2. The caller must not be compromised.
3. Each invitee must either not exist or be a mock profile.

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. A user attempts to invite multiple addresses in a single transaction using the bulkInviteAddresses function.
2. The function iterates over the invitees array, calling inviteAddress for each address.
3. If any single call to inviteAddress reverts (e.g., due to an invalid state), the entire transaction is reverted, resulting in no invites being processed.

### Impact

The user suffers the inability to send any invites if even one invite fails, leading to potential frustration and inefficiency. This design flaw may result in legitimate users missing opportunities to invite others, negatively affecting the network's growth and engagement.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To enhance the `bulkInviteAddresses` function, consider implementing a mechanism that allows individual invite failures to be logged while continuing with subsequent invites. This can be achieved by using a try/catch pattern or similar approach to catch and handle errors for each invite. Hereâ€™s a suggested implementation
```solidity 
function bulkInviteAddresses(address[] calldata invitees) external whenNotPaused {
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < invitees.length; i++) {
        try this.inviteAddress(invitees[i]) {
            // Invite processed successfully
        } catch {
            // Log or handle the failure without reverting the entire transaction
            continue; // Proceed to the next invite
        }
    }

}
```
By implementing this change, the contract will allow successful invites to be processed even if some invites fail, improving user experience and network engagement.
