# Creation of profile is impossible

### Summary

`createProfile()` is responsible for either creating a new profile, or adding an invited address to an already existing profile.

The issue is that if we want to create a new profile, it will **always revert** in `_inviterProfileAuthorizedSender()` due to retrieving a non-existing invite index and failing both parts of the [if condition](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L637)

### Root Cause

The root cause is that we have no checks on a higher lever in `createProfile()` to let the function know if the specified address is invited, or an address that is to be assigned to a new profile.

So if we want to create a new profile, it will revert in `_inviterProfileAuthorizedSender()` due to an address not being in the invite list of the `msg.sender` (which is kind of expected, because this address is intended for a creation of a profile, not an addition to an already existing one)

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Alice wants to create a brand new profile by calling `createProfile()`
2. The process will not complete due to the revert in `__inviterProfileAuthorizedSender()`

### Impact

Profile can't be created and it will **always result in a revert**.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a boolean to differentiate between creating a new profile and adding a new address to an already existing one.
