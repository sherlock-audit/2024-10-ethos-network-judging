# Malicious Users can Lock Valuable Attestation Permanently

### Summary

A flawed address removal mechanism will cause permanent attestation lockout for legitimate claimants as malicious actors can claim, archive and abandon attestations through address removal, making them permanently unrecoverable.

### Root Cause

In web2 platforms like X.com/Instagram, account ownership frequently changes due to trademark claims, legitimate purchases, or company acquisitions. However, in EthosAttestation.sol, the restoration check enforces strict profile ownership without accounting for legitimate ownership transfers:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L382
In `EthosAttestation.sol`, the restoration check requires valid profile ownership:
```solidity
function restoreAttestation(bytes32 attestationHash) public whenNotPaused {
    uint256 profileId = attestationByHash[attestationHash].profileId;
    // Profile ownership check that can be exploited
    bool senderBelongsToProfile = IEthosProfile(ethosProfile).addressBelongsToProfile(
        msg.sender,
        profileId
    );
    if (!senderBelongsToProfile) {
        revert AddressNotInProfile(msg.sender, profileId);
    }
}
```

There is no administrative capability to transfer attestations in any state:
- Archived attestations can only be restored by original owner
- Active attestations can only be claimed by new owners if the original owner allows it
- No admin override exists for either case

This means even with legitimate trademark claims or purchases, if the original owner refuses to cooperate, the attestation cannot be transferred at all.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker claims attestation for valuable handle that they manage to get ownership of (e.g., twitter.com/brandname that is upcoming or has renamed itself)
2. Attacker may optionally call archiveAttestation() to archive the attestation
3. Attacker may optionally call deleteAddressAtIndex() to remove their only profile address and lock the attestation.
5. When legitimate owner (e.g., trademark holder or purchaser) post ownership transfer on the original platform,  tries to claim the handle on ethos:

- They cannot claim it
- No mechanism exists for legal/admin transfer

This issue can also happen due to non-malicious reasons, like compromise of address of the original profile.

### Impact

Real-world entities cannot claim attestations for their rightfully owned social media accounts when:

- Company acquires social media handles through purchase
- Trademark owners win legal claims to usernames
- Businesses undergo rebranding/consolidation
- Legitimate account ownership transfers occur
- This creates a significant barrier for enterprise adoption and legal compliance.
