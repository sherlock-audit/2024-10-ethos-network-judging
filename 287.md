# `abi.encodePacked` Allows Hash Collision in `EthosAttestation::getServiceAndAccountHash`

### Summary

From the solidity [documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/abi-spec.html?highlight=collisions#non-standard-packed-mode):

> If you use `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(a, b))` and both `a` and `b` are dynamic types, it is easy to craft collisions in the hash value by moving parts of `a` into `b` and vice-versa. More specifically, `abi.encodePacked("a", "bc") == abi.encodePacked("ab", "c")`.

The `EthosAttestation` contract uses the same approach to obtain the attestation hash from its service and account data.


### Root Cause

Using `abi.encodePacked` with dynamic types could lead to improper [`hashStr`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L202) being returned when creating attestations. Moreover, these dynamic values are user-specified function arguments, meaning anyone can directly specify the value of these arguments when calling the function.

### Attack Path

### Impact

Attestation data could end up being maliciously changed due to the chance of obtaining the same `hashStr` from different combinations of the `service` and `account` of the attestation.

### Mitigation

Either use `abi.encode` or consider rewriting the function to take the hashed value as a function argument directly so that the hashing process happens off-chain. This approach would solve the issue and save gas.
