# Deleted(Compromised) user can freely interact with almost every function in the `EthosProfile` contract as well as with the rest of the contract in the Ethos network

### Summary

The `EthosProfile` contract serves as the primary profile management system of the `Ethos Network` protocol. Users who join the network will first interact with EthosProfile to create their profile and receive a unique `profile ID`. When a `profile` is created, users can register additional addresses, as well as to delete them, if they become compromised, in order to limit their abilities. However, with the current implementation, after an address is deleted, it can freely interact with the `EthosProfile` contract, doing actions such as to delete, register, archive or restore other addresses under the same `profileId`. To make matters worse, none of the other contracts check for deleted addresses, meaning that compromised accounts can also interact with the rest of the Ethos network.

### Root Cause

There are no `isCompromised` checks for the `msg.sender` in almost any of the functions in the `EthosProfile` contract (as well as in any of the other contracts in the Ethos Network). Currently, compromised users are only limited in terms of being invited to the `EthosProfile` contract.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A User in a verified profile registers an additional address to his/her profile.
2. The new address gets compromised.
3. The user deletes the compromised address from the profile using `deleteAddressAtIndex(...)`

### External pre-conditions

1. The additional address registered by the user gets compromised.

### Attack Path

1. After the user deletes the compromised address it is marked as `compromised`.
2. The compromised address can then freely call [`deleteAddressAtIndex`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L415) with the initial user's index and thus delete the trustworthy address.

```solidity
function deleteAddressAtIndex(uint256 addressIndex) external whenNotPaused {
@>   uint256 profileId = profileIdByAddress[msg.sender]; // when called by a compromised user, it will return a verified profileID
@>  (bool verified, bool archived, bool mock) = profileStatusById(profiled); // with the verified profile ID, this check will pass
        if (!verified) {
            revert ProfileNotFoundForAddress(msg.sender);
        }
        if (archived || mock) {
            revert ProfileAccess(profileId, "Profile is archived");
        }

        address[] storage addresses = profiles[profileId].addresses;
        address[] storage removedAddresses = profiles[profileId].removedAddresses;
        if (addresses.length <= addressIndex) {
            revert InvalidIndex();
        }

@>  address addressStr = addresses[addressIndex]; // the compromised address will pass the initial user's address and will mark it as compromised
        isAddressCompromised[addressStr] = true;
        _addressShouldDifferFromSender(addressStr);

@>  _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray(addressIndex, addresses, removedAddresses); // trustworthy user gets removed

        emit AddressClaim(profileId, addressStr, AddressClaimStatus.Unclaimed);
    }
```
3. The issue spans over the `registerAddress(...)`, `uninviteUser(...)`, `restoreProfile(...)`, and `archiveProfile(...)` functions as well, as they also fail to check if the `msg.sender` is compromised, meaning that compromised users can even archive the whole profile, disallowing it from interacting with rest of the Ethos Network

### Impact

1. Compromised addresses can change the state of the `EthosProfile` contract leading to unauthorized access and griefing of normal trustworthy users and profiles.
2. Compromised addresses can also interact with the rest of the Ethos network.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Add proper `isCompromised` checks to the `msg.sender` functions in the `EthosProfile` contract (similar to how its done for the `invitee` in the `inviteAddress(...) function).
