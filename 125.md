# Deleted address will archive or resotre attestations.

### Summary

`EthosAttestation::archiveAttestation()` uses `EthosProfile::addressBelongsToProfile()` in order to verify if `msg.sender` have the authority to do it. However, even though `msg.sender` is already deleted from the profile, `addressBelongsToProfile()` function returns `true`.

### Root Cause

The relevant code of the [EthosAttestation::archiveAttestation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L334) function is following.
```solidity
  function archiveAttestation(bytes32 attestationHash) external whenNotPaused {
    ---- SKIP ----
    // ensure attestation belongs to sender
    uint256 profileId = attestationByHash[attestationHash].profileId;
    bool senderBelongsToProfile = IEthosProfile(_getEthosProfile()).addressBelongsToProfile(
      msg.sender,
      profileId
    );

    if (!senderBelongsToProfile) {
      revert AddressNotInProfile(msg.sender, profileId);
    }
    ---- SKIP ----
  }
```
As seen, `EthosAttestation::archiveAttestation()` uses `EthosProfile::addressBelongsToProfile()` in order to authorize `msg.sender`. The code of the [EthosProfile::addressBelongsToProfile()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L532) function is following.
```solidity
  function addressBelongsToProfile(
    address addressStr,
    uint256 profileId
  ) external view returns (bool) {
    if (profileIdByAddress[addressStr] == 0) {
      revert ProfileNotFoundForAddress(addressStr);
    }
    return profileIdByAddress[addressStr] == profileId;
  }
```
As seen, the function only verify `profileIdByAddress`. However, since `profileIdByAddress` is not deleted when [EthosProfile::deleteAddressAtIndex()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L415) delete an address from a profile, `addressBelongsToProfile()` function returns `true` even for the deleted address. As a result deleted address will archive attestations. The same vulnerability also exists in [EthosAttestation::restoreAttestation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L365).


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. `addrA` is registered to `profileA`.
2. Attestation for `accountA` is associated to `profileA`.
3. `addrA` is compromised and subsequently is deleted from `profileA`.
4. The malicious user who compromise `addrA` archive the attestation for `accountA` by calling `EthosAttestation::archiveAttestation()` using `addrA`.


### Impact

Broken functionality, as deleted address will archive or resotre attestations.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

It is recommended to verify if the address is deleted in `EthosProfile::addressBelongsToProfile()`.
