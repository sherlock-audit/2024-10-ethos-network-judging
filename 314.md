# EthosProfile which contains multiple address cannot work with `archiveReview() and `restoreReview()`

### Summary

EthosProfile which contains multiple address cannot work with `archiveReview() and `restoreReview()`

### Root Cause

### Internal pre-conditions

- There should be a EthosProfile which contains multiple address in that profile.


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- Let's understand using an example.
- Let's suppose there is a Ethos Profile which contains 3 addresses AddrA, AddrB, AddrC.
-  Lets suppose AddrC  added review earlier using `addReview()` where author is set as msg.sender
```solidity
reviews[reviewCount] = Review({
      archived: false,
      score: score,
      authorProfileId: authorProfileId,
      author: msg.sender,
      subject: subject,
      reviewId: reviewCount,
      // solhint-disable-next-line not-rely-on-time
      createdAt: block.timestamp,
      comment: comment,
      metadata: metadata,
      attestationDetails: attestationDetails
    });
```
- Now AddrC get's compromised and is not part of that Ethos Profile.
- Now other Ethos Profile address can't `archiveReview() and `restoreReview()` because of the below check
```solidity
if (review.author != msg.sender) {
      revert UnauthorizedArchiving(reviewId);
    }
```
- `In case of account compromises, a profile can unregister an account and mark it as compromised.`
- In this case other ethosProfile addresses can't archive and restore the review.
- This is clearly not a design choice as this case is handled properly in another function `editReview()`
```solidity
if (review.authorProfileId != authorProfileId) {
      revert UnauthorizedEdit(reviewId);
    }
```    


### Impact

- Other addresses of EthosProfile will not not be able to restore and archive reviews due to msg.sender check.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Add a similar check which is their inside `editReview()`
```solidity
if (review.authorProfileId != authorProfileId) {
      revert UnauthorizedEdit(reviewId);
    }
```
