# Lack of proper validations in EthosDiscussion.sol lets a compromised address to add malicious replys on user's behalf

### Summary

In 'EthosDiscussion.sol', no proper validation is done to ensure that the address that add the reply is not a compromised address of the user.

### Root Cause

In 'EthosDiscussion.sol', addReply() function is used to add reply to any activity in Ethos.

```Solidity
 function addReply(
    address targetContract,
    uint256 targetId,
    string memory content,
    string memory metadata
  ) external onlyNonZeroAddress(targetContract) whenNotPaused {
    uint256 authorID = IEthosProfile(
      contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(ETHOS_PROFILE)
    ).verifiedProfileIdForAddress(msg.sender);

    bool isTargetThisContract = _isAddressThisContract(targetContract);

    if (isTargetThisContract) {
      if (replies[targetId].createdAt == 0) {
        revert TargetNotFound(targetContract, targetId);
      }
    } else {
      _checkIfTargetExistsAndAllowed(targetContract, targetId);
    }

    uint256 _replyCount = replyCount;

    directReplyIdsByTargetAddressAndTargetId[targetContract][targetId].push(_replyCount);
    replyIdsByAuthor[authorID].push(_replyCount);

    replies[_replyCount] = Reply(
      !isTargetThisContract,
      targetContract,
      authorID,
      _replyCount,
      targetId,
      block.timestamp,
      0,
      content,
      metadata
    );

    emit ReplyAdded(authorID, targetContract, _replyCount);

    replyCount++;
  }
```

 Even though it has no direct link to credibility score calculation , it can be used to leave a bad reputation if the user acts maliciously in discussions. So if an address is compromised/hacked , this address can still add malicious replies and that will be added on behalf of the user profile and that can affect the user's reputation


### Impact

Compromised/hacked address can still add malicious replies and that will be added on behalf of the user profile



### Mitigation

In addReply() add proper validation to ensure that msg.sender is not a compromised address:

```Solidity
 function addReply(
    address targetContract,
    uint256 targetId,
    string memory content,
    string memory metadata
  ) external onlyNonZeroAddress(targetContract) whenNotPaused {
    uint256 authorID = IEthosProfile(
      contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(ETHOS_PROFILE)
    ).verifiedProfileIdForAddress(msg.sender);

    if(IEthosProfile(ethosProfile).isAddressCompromised[msg.sender])
    revert CompromisedAddress(msg.sender);


    bool isTargetThisContract = _isAddressThisContract(targetContract);

    if (isTargetThisContract) {
      if (replies[targetId].createdAt == 0) {
        revert TargetNotFound(targetContract, targetId);
      }
    } else {
      _checkIfTargetExistsAndAllowed(targetContract, targetId);
    }

    uint256 _replyCount = replyCount;

    directReplyIdsByTargetAddressAndTargetId[targetContract][targetId].push(_replyCount);
    replyIdsByAuthor[authorID].push(_replyCount);

    replies[_replyCount] = Reply(
      !isTargetThisContract,
      targetContract,
      authorID,
      _replyCount,
      targetId,
      block.timestamp,
      0,
      content,
      metadata
    );

    emit ReplyAdded(authorID, targetContract, _replyCount);

    replyCount++;
  }
```
