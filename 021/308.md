# a re-registred address will count double in the sum of checkMaxAddresses

### Summary

in EthosProfile, one of the features of `registerAddress()` is the ability to re-register a deleted address in case of an accident delete for example .
when an address is deleted [it is added to the `removedAddresses` for that profile ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L591) .
When an address is re-registred,[ the address is added to the `addresses` array](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L403) of that profile  and `removedAddresses` for that profile is not updated to remove the address .
Also there is a maximum [limit ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L732-L738) of addresses a profile can have associated to, this limit includes the addresses added + the addresses removed . And because the address is not removed from `removedAddresses` array when its re-registred, it will count twice ( one time in `addresses ` and one time in `removedAddresses` ) reducing the total number of addresses a profile can have associated to .
The impact can be consequent when the max number set by the protocol is low ( [we know that the default is 128](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/documentation/ethosProfile.md?plain=1#L55), also re-registering an address can happen multiple times in the lifetime of a profile .

### Root Cause

when an address is re-registred `removedAddresses` for that profile is not updated to remove the address .

### Internal pre-conditions

1. address is deleted .
2. address is re-registred .

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

re-registering an address can happen multiple times on a lifetime of a profile, so the impact can be consequent . 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

when an address is re-registred `removedAddresses` for that profile must be updated to remove the address .
