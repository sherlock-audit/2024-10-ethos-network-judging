# `EthosProfile#deleteAddressAtIndex()` should implement an address check to avoid removing the wrong address.


### Summary

`EthosProfile#deleteAddressAtIndex()` should implement an address check to avoid removing the wrong address. The current implementation may cause removing the wrong address due to blockchain execution latency.

### Root Cause

When users are calling `deleteAddressAtIndex()`, only an index is specified. The address stored in the index is removed from `profiles[profileId].addresses`.

The issue here is, because we cannot force the order of blockchain transaction execution (e.g. due to latency, gas-fees, etc.), users may be ending up removing the wrong address.

Example, say the current address array is `[A, B, C, D, E]`:

1. User wants to remove `B`, so he runs `deleteAddressAtIndex(addressIndex = 1)`. The expected array is `[A, B, D, E]`.
2. User wants to remove `D`, so he runs `deleteAddressAtIndex(addressIndex = 2)`. The expected array is `[A, B, E]`.

However, due to blockchain latency, transaction 2 is executed before 1. So the final array is `[A, B, C, D, E] -> [A, B, D, E] -> [A, D, E]`.

Also, given that there are multiple addresses in a ProfileId, the transactions may be initiated differently, and they have no idea of the other transaction. Which would make it more likely for this to happen.

```solidity
  function deleteAddressAtIndex(uint256 addressIndex) external whenNotPaused {
    uint256 profileId = profileIdByAddress[msg.sender];
    (bool verified, bool archived, bool mock) = profileStatusById(profileId);
    if (!verified) {
      revert ProfileNotFoundForAddress(msg.sender);
    }
    if (archived || mock) {
      revert ProfileAccess(profileId, "Profile is archived");
    }

    address[] storage addresses = profiles[profileId].addresses;
    address[] storage removedAddresses = profiles[profileId].removedAddresses;
    if (addresses.length <= addressIndex) {
      revert InvalidIndex();
    }

    address addressStr = addresses[addressIndex];
    isAddressCompromised[addressStr] = true;
    _addressShouldDifferFromSender(addressStr);

    _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray(addressIndex, addresses, removedAddresses);

    emit AddressClaim(profileId, addressStr, AddressClaimStatus.Unclaimed);
  }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

Two `deleteAddressAtIndex()` transactions are initiated with their final execution order not the same as initiate order.

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

Users may end up removing the incorrect address. Note that this is not irrevocable because the `isAddressCompromised[address]` would always be marked as true once the address is removed, and it cannot be restored even if we register it back again.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Also add an address parameter in `deleteAddressAtIndex()`, and always check the removed address is the same as the one passed in.
