# Compromised addresses can interact with the whole system and grief other users

### Summary

In Ethos, each user has a profile identified by a unique id, which can have multiple associated addresses. Profiles can receive reviews, votes, attestations, and comments.

If a user removes an address from their profile, the address becomes marked as **compromised** and is intended to be restricted with the system. This is confirmed in the documentation and by the sponsor:

> - **isAddressCompromised**: (mapping(address => bool)) Keeps track of addresses that are compromised, preventing certain actions from being taken by these addresses.

[_documentation/ethosProfile.md_](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/documentation/ethosProfile.md)

However, the `archiveAttestation()` and `restoreAttestation()` functions in `EthosAttestation.sol` do not check if the address is compromised, allowing it to perform these actions.

```solidity
334:  function archiveAttestation(bytes32 attestationHash) external whenNotPaused {
        ...
        // ensure attestation belongs to sender
        uint256 profileId = attestationByHash[attestationHash].profileId;
  ðŸ“Œ    bool senderBelongsToProfile = IEthosProfile(_getEthosProfile()).addressBelongsToProfile(msg.sender, profileId);
        if (!senderBelongsToProfile) {
            revert AddressNotInProfile(msg.sender, profileId);
        }
      ...
    }
```

[_EthosAttestation.sol#342_](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L342)

```solidity
532: function addressBelongsToProfile(address addressStr, uint256 profileId) external view returns (bool) {
        ...
        return profileIdByAddress[addressStr] == profileId;
    }
```

[_EthosProfile.sol#539_](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L539)

The function `addressBelongsToProfile()` only checks if the address is mapped to the profile ID in the `profileIdByAddress` mapping but does not consider whether the address is compromised. As a result, compromised addresses can still interact with the system, which violates the intended design.

Due to `verifiedProfileIdForAddress()` and `profileStatusByAddress()` also being vulnerable by this issue, the following functions can be also used by a compromised address:

- EthosDiscussion
  - `addReply()`, `editReply()`
- EthosReview
  - `addReview()`, `editReview()`, `archiveReview()`, `restoreReview()`
- EthosProfile
  - `archiveProfile()`, `restoreProfile()`, **`inviteAddress()`**, `uninviteUser()`, **`registerAddress()`**
    _(compromised addresses can even register more addresses to the profile that are not marked as compromissed and do further damage)_
- EthosAttestation
  - `createAttestation()`, `archiveAttestation()`, `restoreAttestation()`


### Root Cause

`checkIsAddressCompromised()` checks are missing inside `profileStatusByAddress()`, `verifiedProfileIdForAddress()`, and `addressBelongsToProfile()` functions.

### Internal pre-conditions

User has a compromised address.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. UserA's address becomes compromised.
2. The malicious actor with access to the compromised address can interact with the system as if it is not compromised.
3. Malicious actor leaves neagtive reviews, votes, comments, etc.

### Impact

Compromised addresses can interact with the system as if they were not compromised, allowing malicious actions (e.g., leaving negative reviews, votes, comments, etc), which can impact users' social status. The original profile owner is unable to remove the compromised address, meaning **damage done by the compromised address cannot be undone**. 

The profile owner **needs to create a new profile** to get rid of the compromised address.

### PoC


The following PoC demonstrates how a **compromised address can archive and restore attestations**. But the **same concept can be applied to other functions** mentioned above.

Place the code in `attestation.create.test.ts`:

```typescript
// eslint-disable-next-line jest/no-focused-tests
it.only('should be able to archive and restore attestation from compromised profile', async () => {
  const signature = await common.signatureForCreateAttestation(
    '2',
    '3592832',
    ACCOUNT_NAME_BEN,
    SERVICE_X,
    ATTESTATION_EVIDENCE_0,
    EXPECTED_SIGNER,
  );

  await ethosAttestation
    .connect(userA.signer)
    .createAttestation(
      2,
      3592832,
      { account: ACCOUNT_NAME_BEN, service: SERVICE_X },
      ATTESTATION_EVIDENCE_0,
      signature,
    );
  const aHash = await ethosAttestation.getServiceAndAccountHash(SERVICE_X, ACCOUNT_NAME_BEN);
  const attestation = await ethosAttestation.getAttestationByHash(aHash);

  expect(attestation.archived).to.be.equal(false);

  const blocked = await deployer.newWallet();
  const signatureForRegistration = await common.signatureForRegisterAddress(
    blocked.address,
    (2).toString(),
    (222323).toString(),
    EXPECTED_SIGNER,
  );

  await ethosProfile
    .connect(userA.signer)
    .registerAddress(blocked.address, 2, 222323, signatureForRegistration);
  await ethosProfile.connect(userA.signer).deleteAddressAtIndex(1);

  await expect(ethosProfile.checkIsAddressCompromised(blocked.address))
    .to.be.revertedWithCustomError(ethosProfile, 'AddressCompromised')
    .withArgs(ethers.getAddress(blocked.address));

  // should try to archive attestation from compromised profile
  await ethosAttestation.connect(blocked).archiveAttestation(aHash);
  const attestationAfterArchive = await ethosAttestation.getAttestationByHash(aHash);
  expect(attestationAfterArchive.archived).to.be.equal(true);

  // should try to restore attestation from compromised profile
  await ethosAttestation.connect(blocked).restoreAttestation(aHash);
  const attestationAfterRestore = await ethosAttestation.getAttestationByHash(aHash);
  expect(attestationAfterRestore.archived).to.be.equal(false);
});
```

</details>

### Mitigation

Add `checkIsAddressCompromised()`@EthosProfile to `addressBelongsToProfile()` and `profileStatusByAddress()` functions.
