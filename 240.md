# Registered User Can Block New Addresses from Creating Profiles on Ethos.

### Summary

The vulnerability allows an existing Ethos user to prevent another user from joining the Ethos platform by compromising their address before an invitation is processed. By exploiting the `registerAddress()` and `deleteAddressAtIndex()` functions, an attacker can maliciously mark an address as compromised, thereby blocking the intended invitation.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability arises because the `deleteAddressAtIndex()` function marks an address as compromised when removed, without validating the context or intent of the action. This enables malicious users to register and then delete any address, permanently compromising it and preventing the associated user from being invited to Ethos.

### Attack Path

1. **Invitation Initiated**: UserA attempts to invite UserB by calling the `inviteAddress()` function. This transaction is visible on the blockchain and is pending confirmation.
2. **Attack Execution**: Before UserA’s transaction is processed, Alice (an existing malicious Ethos user) intercepts UserB’s address. 
3. **Compromise Address**: Alice calls `registerAddress()` and passes a valid signature to associate UserB's address with her own Ethos profile.
4. **Mark Address as Compromised**: Alice then calls `deleteAddressAtIndex()` to remove UserB's address from her registered addresses. The function logic marks UserB’s address as compromised:
   ```solidity
   isAddressCompromised[addressStr] = true;
   ```
5. **Invitation Failure**: UserB’s address is now flagged as compromised, causing UserA’s invitation to fail. Consequently, UserB cannot create a profile or join the Ethos platform.

### Impact

1. **Permanent Blocking**: This exploit permanently prevents the intended user (UserB) from joining Ethos, disrupting user onboarding and impacting the platform’s growth.
2. **Denial of Service**: Malicious users can systematically block multiple new users from joining, creating a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition for Ethos registration.
