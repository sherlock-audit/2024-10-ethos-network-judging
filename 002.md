# Missing gap to Avoid Storage Collisions

### Summary

The contracts in scope are intended to be upgradable smart contracts but do not have a `__gap` variable.
In upgradeable contracts, it's crucial to include a `_gap` to ensure that any additional storage variables added in future contract upgrades do not collide with existing storage variables. This is especially important when inheriting from multiple upgradeable contracts.

For example [EthosAttestation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L59) contract is upgradable withoud `__gap[]` variable.

### Mitigation

Include a `_gap` as the last storage variable to all contracts that are intented to be upgradable contracts to reserve space for future storage variables and prevent storage collisions. This is a common practice to ensure compatibility and avoid issues when upgrading the contract in the future.
