# Profile Inaccessibility Due to Sole Address Deletion.

### Summary

The users profile might become inaccessible for the system.

### Root Cause

The deleteAddressAtIndex function removes a registered address from a userâ€™s profileId based on the specified addressIndex, marking the address as inaccessible for further use:
```solidity
    isAddressCompromised[addressStr] = true;
```

However, users might accidentally call the `deleteAddressAtIndex` function when their profile has only one registered address, which would render their profile inaccessible within the ethos system.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions
User should not be able to remove 0th index.


### Attack Path



### Impact

Users will not be able to interact with system when this happens.
The profile will become inaccessible.

Disallow to delete registered address in that situation.
