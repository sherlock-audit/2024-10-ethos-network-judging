# Addresses can be registered multiple times for the same profile

### Summary

In the `registerAddress` function of `EthosProfile.sol`, due to the incorrect validation, profiles will be able to register the same address multiple times.

### Root Cause

In [`registerAddress.sol:388`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L388) The validation is handled incorrectly. This is how the validation when registering addresses is currently handled:
```solidity
    // you may restore your own previously deleted address,
    // but you cannot register an address that has been deleted by another user
    if (profileIdByAddress[addressStr] != profileId && isAddressCompromised[addressStr]) {
      revert AddressCompromised(addressStr);
    }
    (bool addressAlreadyRegistered, , , uint256 registeredProfileId) = profileStatusByAddress(
      addressStr
    );
    if (addressAlreadyRegistered && registeredProfileId != profileId) {
      revert ProfileExistsForAddress(addressStr);
    }
```

As we can see, the current implementation allows for addresses that have already been registered to a profile to be registered multiple times, causing the `profiles[profileId].addresses` to be filled with duplicated values, making the output of `addressesForProfile` to be incorrect.

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

An address is registered to a profile multiple times, compromising the output of `addressesForProfile`.

### Impact

The same addresses can be registered to a profile multiple times, causing the results of important functions to be incorrect.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Make sure that the scenario where a an address is registered multiple times is handled correctly.
