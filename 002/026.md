# Reviews for Mock Profiles Not Persisting Upon Subject Registration

## Summary
When users leave reviews for unregistered addresses, a temporary mock profile is created, and reviews are linked to it. However, if the address is later registered to an existing profile, these reviews do not persist or transfer to the new profile.

## Vulnerability Details
Users can leave reviews for `subjects` (addresses)/attestations that are not yet registered in the Ethos network. In such cases, a *"mock"* profile is created, and the review is assigned to this mock profile:
```solidity
function _addReview(uint256 mockId, address subject, bool isAttestation, bytes32 attestationHash, IEthosProfile ethosProfile)
  internal returns (uint256 subjectProfileId) {
    // if profileId does not exist for subject, create and record a "mock"
    if (mockId == 0) {
>>>   subjectProfileId = ethosProfile.incrementProfileCount(
        isAttestation,
        subject,
        attestationHash
      );
    } else {
      subjectProfileId = mockId;
    }

>>>   reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId[subjectProfileId].push(reviewCount);
  }
```
The mock profile created for a non-registered subject is initialized as new profile in `EthosProfile::incrementProfileCount`:
```solidity
function incrementProfileCount(bool isAttestation, address subject, bytes32 attestation) external whenNotPaused returns (uint256 profileId) {
    if (
      msg.sender != contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(ETHOS_REVIEW) &&
      msg.sender != contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(ETHOS_ATTESTATION)
    ) {
      revert InvalidSender();
    }
>>>    profileId = profileCount;
    if (isAttestation) {
      profileIdByAttestation[attestation] = profileId;
    } else {
>>>      profileIdByAddress[subject] = profileId;
    }
    profileCount++;
    emit MockProfileCreated(profileId);
}
```
When the subject address is subsequently **registered to an existing profile**, the address is [assigned a another profile ID](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/979e352d7bcdba3d0665f11c0320041ce28d1b89/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L404), and reviews previously associated with the mock profile are not transferred:
```solidity
function registerAddress(
  address addressStr, uint256 profileId, uint256 randValue, bytes calldata signature) external whenNotPaused onlyNonZeroAddress(addressStr) {
    // --SNIP
    profiles[profileId].addresses.push(addressStr);
>>>    profileIdByAddress[addressStr] = profileId;
    checkMaxAddresses(profileId);
    emit AddressClaim(profileId, addressStr, AddressClaimStatus.Claimed);
}
```
Here, `profileIdByAddress[addressStr]` is updated to the assigned profile ID, resulting in the reviews tied to the mock profile being lost.

## Proof Of Concept
Consider the following example where 5 profiles already exist.

- A user leaves a negative review for address `0xabcde`, which is not yet registered. A mock profile with ID `6` is created for `0xabcde`, and the review is assigned to this profile.
  ```solidity
  function _addReview(uint256 mockId, address subject, bool isAttestation, bytes32 attestationHash, IEthosProfile ethosProfile
  ) internal returns (uint256 subjectProfileId) {
    if (mockId == 0) {
      subjectProfileId = ethosProfile.incrementProfileCount(
        isAttestation,
        subject,
        attestationHash
      );
    } else {
      subjectProfileId = mockId;
    }

  // subjectProfileId = 6
  >>>  reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId[subjectProfileId].push(reviewCount);
  }
  ```
- Alice, who owns address `0xabcde` and has profile ID `3`, registers `0xabcde` under her profile by calling `registerAddress`. The address is now associated with profile ID `3`:
  ```solidity
  function registerAddress(address addressStr, uint256 profileId, uint256 randValue, bytes calldata signature
  ) external whenNotPaused onlyNonZeroAddress(addressStr) {
    // --SNIP
    profiles[profileId].addresses.push(addressStr);
    profileIdByAddress[addressStr] = profileId; // profileId = 3
  }
  ```

Consequently, reviews that were previously registered under the mock profile (ID `6`) for `0xabcde` do not persist after registration under profile ID `3`.

## Impact
Reviews for subjects initially created as mock profiles are not transferred or retained once the subject is registered under a new profile. This results in a loss of review data for registered profiles

## Mitigation
Consider implementing a mechanism to transfer reviews from mock profiles to the newly registered profile when the corresponding subject is registered.
