# Use of `transfe`r Instead of `safeTransfer` in `EthosReview` Contract can cause problems in some cases

### Summary

The `EthosReview` contract currently utilizes the `transfer` function for handling token transfers, which can lead to potential vulnerabilities, particularly when interacting with ERC20 tokens. It is highly recommended to use the `safeTransfer` function provided by the OpenZeppelin library to mitigate risks associated with token transfers.

### Root Cause

The contract's design does not implement safety checks that are typically included with the `safeTransfer` function. This oversight can expose the contract to several issues related to ERC20 token transfers, including Lack of Return Value Check , Reentrancy Attack  etc , thease things can appear in few tokens even if they are standard erc20 with 18 decimals . 


### Internal pre-conditions

none

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. An attacker creates or interacts with a malicious ERC20 token that does not conform to the standard implementation.
2. When the transfer function is invoked, it could either silently fail or behave unpredictably, as it does not return a value or require a specific structure.
3. This unexpected behavior could lead to a situation where funds are not transferred as expected, and users could lose access to their tokens without any error message or proper handling by the contract.

### Impact

1. Loss of funds for users if the token does not comply with the expected behavior of the ERC20 standard.
2. Decreased trust in the contract due to potential loss of funds and unexpected behavior.
3. Increased complexity in debugging and handling failed transactions.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To address this vulnerability, it is recommended to replace instances of the transfer function with the safeTransfer function from OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library.
