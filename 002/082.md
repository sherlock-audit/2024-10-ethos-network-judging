# An unclaimable attestation can be created if reviewed with an attestation with no binded profile

### Summary

Reviews will be given to profile, with subject address or attestation as parameter in `EthosReview::addReview`, however if attestation is provided for adding review, and such attestation is not associated with any existing profile, this review will be "lost" in a sense.

### Root Cause

In [`EthosReview::addReview`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosReview.sol#L173), when a new attestation info is provided, the contract would create a new attestation and binds a mock profile with it:
```solidity
  function addReview(
    Score score,
    address subject,
    address paymentToken,
    string calldata comment,
    string calldata metadata,
    AttestationDetails calldata attestationDetails
  ) external payable whenNotPaused {
    _validateReviewDetails(subject, attestationDetails);

    IEthosProfile ethosProfile = _getEthosProfile();
    bytes32 attestationHash;
    uint256 mockId;
    if (subject != address(0)) {
      mockId = ethosProfile.profileIdByAddress(subject);
      mockId = _addReview(mockId, subject, false, 0x0, ethosProfile);
    } else {
      // convert the service/account to a hash as an identifier
      attestationHash = _getEthosAttestation().getServiceAndAccountHash(
        attestationDetails.service,
        attestationDetails.account
      );
      mockId = ethosProfile.profileIdByAttestation(attestationHash);
      mockId = _addReview(mockId, subject, true, attestationHash, ethosProfile);
    }

    uint256 authorProfileId = ethosProfile.verifiedProfileIdForAddress(msg.sender);
    reviewIdsByAuthorProfileId[authorProfileId].push(reviewCount);

    _handlePayment(paymentToken);

    reviews[reviewCount] = Review({
      archived: false,
      score: score,
      authorProfileId: authorProfileId,
      author: msg.sender,
      subject: subject,
      reviewId: reviewCount,
      // solhint-disable-next-line not-rely-on-time
      createdAt: block.timestamp,
      comment: comment,
      metadata: metadata,
      attestationDetails: attestationDetails
    });
    emit ReviewCreated(score, msg.sender, attestationHash, subject, reviewCount, mockId);
    reviewCount++;
  }
```

The general flow of `addReview` follows:
1. Checks if it's a self-review, and only one of the subject and attestation can be non-empty
2. Associate subject or attestation to the profile which is to be reviewed, if there is non, create a mock one.
3. Add review info to the storage, and update author review info
4. Handle payment

In step 2, profile will be created if there is no profile associated with the subject or attestation:
```solidity
  function _addReview(
    uint256 mockId,
    address subject,
    bool isAttestation,
    bytes32 attestationHash,
    IEthosProfile ethosProfile
  ) internal returns (uint256 subjectProfileId) {
    // if profileId does not exist for subject, create and record a "mock"
    if (mockId == 0) {
      subjectProfileId = ethosProfile.incrementProfileCount(
        isAttestation,
        subject,
        attestationHash
      );
    } else {
      subjectProfileId = mockId;
    }

    reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId[subjectProfileId].push(reviewCount);
  }
```

And later in step 3:
```solidity
    reviews[reviewCount] = Review({
      archived: false,
      score: score,
      authorProfileId: authorProfileId,
      author: msg.sender,
      subject: subject,
      reviewId: reviewCount,
      // solhint-disable-next-line not-rely-on-time
      createdAt: block.timestamp,
      comment: comment,
      metadata: metadata,
      attestationDetails: attestationDetails
    });
    emit ReviewCreated(score, msg.sender, attestationHash, subject, reviewCount, mockId);
    reviewCount++;
```

In step 2, we can see that `subjectProfileId` is used  to store `profileId`, and later when a review struct is created, it stores subject and attestation. The issue is, when a mock profile is created with attestation, there are no ways of verifying it. This would leave the mock profile to be unclaimed forever. The attestation, however, can be reclaimed to a new profile with valid signature, as a intended procedure. But this would introduce an unclaimed profile, and a lost review potentially. This can somewhat be considered as a lost review, as no real profile benefits from it.

### Internal pre-conditions

Attestation A is new, and not associated with any profiles.

### External pre-conditions

Alice owns a profile, and she would like to add a review to an attestation which is yet joined the protocol.

### Attack Path

When Alice adds the review, a new profile with attestation A will be created. However, since there are no ways of activiating this mock profile, the review status would gone waste. For attestation, the review still exists.

### Impact

Since a review is added to a profile not reachable, and adding review can potentially cause some funds. The protocol may also use profile reviews and reputations to distribute rewards, this can somewhat be considered as a way of loss of funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a way to claim mock profiles with valid attestation.
