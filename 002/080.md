# Compromised addresses are not restricted in any way

### Summary

If an address is deleted from a profile it becomes compromised but still connected to the profile:
['In case of account compromises, a profile can unregister an account and mark it as compromised.'](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L35)

However, compromised addresses are currently not restricted in any way. This allows them to perform malicious actions on the profile, including: deleting/registering other addresses, inviting users, creating attestations, adding reviews and voting.

### Root Cause

In the [`EthosProfile.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol) contract compromised addresses are not prevented from calling critical functions.
