# VerifiedProfileIdForAddress does not check whether the address has been removed, leading to a privilege bypass.

### Summary

VerifiedProfileIdForAddress is designed to check whether an address has the rights to operate on profile-related actions such as comments, authorizations, discussions, and voting. However, this function does not check if the address is on the removal list of the profile, resulting in excessive power for removed addresses.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L568C1-L574C4  

VerifiedProfileIdForAddress does not check whether the address has been removed, leading to a privilege bypass.

### Internal pre-conditions

There is an address in a profile that has been removed.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

The removed address still has the authority to operate on profile comments, discussions, voting, and authorizations.

### Impact

The impacts include the following:

1. **EthosAttestation.sol**
   - In the `createAttestation` function, removed addresses can still create authorizations.

2. **EthosDiscussion.sol**
   - In the `ditReply` function, removed addresses can still post replies.
   - In the `editReply` function, removed addresses can still modify replies.

3. **EthosReview.sol**
   - In the `addReview` function, removed addresses can still participate in discussions.
   - In the `editReply` function, removed addresses can still modify replies.

4. **EthosVote**
   - In the `voteFor` function, removed addresses can still modify voting statuses.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

  ```diff
- function verifiedProfileIdForAddress(address _address) external view returns (uint256) {
+ function verifiedProfileIdForAddress(address _address) external view checkIfCompromised(_address) returns (uint256) {
      (bool verified, bool archived, bool mock, uint256 profileId) = profileStatusByAddress(_address);
      if (!verified || archived || mock) {
        revert ProfileNotFoundForAddress(_address);
      }
      return profileId;
    }
  ```
