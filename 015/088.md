# Malicious attestations can be created

### Summary

When an attestation is created through `createAttestation` it is validated that the expected signer has approved of this attestation and signed the data. The issue is that the data signed by the signer includes 3 strings which are encoded using `abi.encodePacked`. It is a commonly known issue that [if you use keccak256(abi.encodePacked(a, b)) and both a and b are dynamic types, it is easy to craft collisions in the hash value by moving parts of a into b and vice-versa.](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/abi-spec.html#non-standard-packed-mode:~:text=If%20you%20use%20keccak256(abi.encodePacked(a%2C%20b))%20and%20both%20a%20and%20b%20are%20dynamic%20types%2C%20it%20is%20easy%20to%20craft%20collisions%20in%20the%20hash%20value%20by%20moving%20parts%20of%20a%20into%20b%20and%20vice%2Dversa.)

Thus, the caller will be able to create attestations with data that is different from the data signed by the expected signer, as the `keccak256` of the values will be the same but the actual values will be different.

### Root Cause

In `_keccakForCreateAttestation` when deriving the attestation hash [`abi.encodePacked`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L528) is used on 3 strings:

```solidity
return keccak256(abi.encodePacked(profileId, randValue, account, service, evidence));
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The expected signer has signed data for an attestation with an account: 257724631 and service: x.com.
2. However, the creator can create an attestation with any combination of the two strings, which in some cases may be done maliciously.

### Impact

Users will be able to create malicious attestations, not approved by the expected signer.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use `abi.encode` instead of `abi.encodePacked` in `_keccakForCreateAttestation`.
