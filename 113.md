# _removeAttestationFromPreviousProfile() contains a logical error

### Summary

When `User A` wants to claim an attestation that is created by `User B`, he will call `createAttestation()`, 
 which will invoke in it [_removeAttestationFromPreviousProfile()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L485-L499)

The issue stems on [line 494](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L494) which takes the `prevIndex` of the attestation and assigns it to the latest index and that's it.

If we have 3 attestation hashes, and we want to take the 3rd one from `User A`, it will assign the 3th hash the 2rd index, thus corrupting the mapping with wrong data.


### Root Cause

The root cause is that we **overwrite the last hash index** in the `mapping hashIndexByProfileIdAndHash`, instead of the hash index which will be claimed by the other user, this results in a **totally wrong dataset** in the mapping.

Let's say we have `[hash1, hash2, hash3]` that are held by `User A`.  
`User B` calls `createAttestation()` and claims the `hash2`, `hashIndexByProfileIdAndHash[profileId][hashes[length - 1]] = 2` is overwriting the hash3, which has nothing to do with the current call.

Later on, `User C` wants to claim `User A's` `hash3` attestation, but it will revert due to it being non-existent in [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L466-L478) as it was overwritten due to it being the last index.

### Internal pre-conditions

`User A` has `hash1`, `hash2`, `hash3` in the ```mapping hashIndexByProfileIdAndHash``` for the purpose of the attack path

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. `User A` has his `hash2` claimed by `User B` via `createAttestation()`
2. The function goes through `_removeAttestationFromPreviousProfile()` and overwrites [the last hash index](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L494) of `User A` - `hash3`, instead of the one actually being claimed in line 494
3. Later on, `User A` wants to claim `User A's` `hash3`, but it will revert in [getAttestationIndexByProfileIdAndHash()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L473-L476) due to it being non-existent in the `mapping hashIndexByProfileIdAndHash`, **from the action explained in step 2**, even though it sits in `User A`.

### Impact

The mapping will contain the wrong dataset, **thus reverting** if the last index is to be claimed by another user as specified in the attack scenario.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Nullify the hash that is actually being claimed, not the last one.
