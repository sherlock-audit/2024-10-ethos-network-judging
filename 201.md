# Address is still marked as compromised when registered back by `registerAddress`.


### Summary

If an address is removed from a profileId, it will be marked as compromised. However, when it is added back, the compromised mark is still there.

### Root Cause

Users belonging to a profileId can call `deleteAddressAtIndex()` to remove an address and mark as compromised: `isAddressCompromised[addressStr] = true;`.

However, when restoring the deleted address by `registerAddress()`, the `isAddressCompromised[addressStr]` is still marked as true.

The sponsor responded "*Yes, you can restore an address you deleted. We don't want folks to accidentally delete an address and be unable to 'undo' it.*" when asked about restoring the deleted address. Thus the compromised mark should be removed as well.

Considering that the EthosProfile contract serves as a database to the upper frontend app, it is critical that the data is stored correctly, thus a medium severity issue.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. User deletes an address from Profile, and restores it later.

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

If an address is removed from a profileId, it will be marked as compromised. However, when it is added back, the compromised mark is still there.

Considering that the EthosProfile contract serves as a database to the upper frontend app, it is critical that the data is stored correctly.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Always `isAddressCompromised[addressStr] = false` in `registerAddress()`.
