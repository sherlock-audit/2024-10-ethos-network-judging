# Anyone can register themselves or any address to any profile and delete the address of the owners of those profiles (including Owner's profile) they choose without even having a profile.

### Summary

`registerAddress()` has no check to ensure `profileIdByAddress(msg.sender) != 0`  hence attackers(or even regular users ) can hijack other peoples profiles and registering their addresses to that profile. All they need is to know the `profileId ` of the profile they want to hijack. Which can lead to lots and lots spam reviews and votes, which would reduce the integrity of the protocol.

### Root Cause

- The lack of verification that  `caller` of  `registerAddress()` is registered to that `profileId`

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Attacker/User calls `registerAddress()`
2. _profileShouldHaveInvites() returns true (The profile has not exceeded it's invite limit).

### External pre-conditions

1. Attacker obtains the profileId of target profile.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker/User calls `registerAddress()` with any valid profileId.


### Impact

- Anyone can be affiliated/registered to not just ethos but almost any profile of their choice
