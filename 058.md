# Malicious user can steal another's attestation.

### Summary

`EthosAttestation._keccakForCreateAttestation()` function uses `abi.encodePacked()`, which is vulnerable to hash collision attacks.
By exploiting this vulnerability, malicious user can steal another user's attestation.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L528

### Root Cause

`EthosAttestation._keccakForCreateAttestation()` function is following.
```solidity
  function _keccakForCreateAttestation(
    uint256 profileId,
    uint256 randValue,
    string calldata account,
    string calldata service,
    string calldata evidence
  ) private pure returns (bytes32) {
    return keccak256(abi.encodePacked(profileId, randValue, account, service, evidence));
  }
```
As can be seen, the function uses `abi.encodePacked()` to encode the message. Here `service` refers to the social media service (e.g., `x.com` or `fb.com`) and `account` refers to the user's account name (e.g., `benwalther256` or `ivansolo512`). Since there is no restrictions on `service` and `account`, this can lead to hash collisions.
By exploiting this vulnerability, a malicious user can steal another user's attestation.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

There must exist social media services whose names have an inclusion relationship (e.g., `fb.com` and `xfb.com`).


### Attack Path

1. Assume that there exist social media services named `fb.com` and `xfb.com`.
2. A user has an account named `auser` on `xfb.com` with a high reputation. 
3. An attacker creates an account named `auserx` on `fb.com`.
4. The attacker obtains a signature `sig1` in Ethos web app using `account = 'auserx'` and `service = 'fb.com'`.
5. The attacker creates an attestation by calling `EthosAttestation.createAttestation()` function with `account = 'auser'`, `service = 'xfb.com'` and `signature = 'sig1'`.
6. Thus the attacker has stolen attestation from another user with a high reputation.


### Impact

A malicious attacker can increase his reputation by stealing another user's attestation. This harms the legitimate user by stealing their account attestation and reputation.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use `abi.encode()` function instead of `abi.encodePacked()` in the `EthosAttestation._keccakForCreateAttestation()` to avoid hash collisions.
