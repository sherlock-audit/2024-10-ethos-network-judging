# Mock profiles can receive reviews but cannot receive votes or comments due to contract inconsistencies

### Summary

In Ethos, each user has a profile identified by a unique id, which can have multiple addresses. Profiles can receive reviews, votes, attestations, and comments.

If an address doesn't belong to a profile, a new **MOCK** profile is created. Mock profiles track reviews, votes and comments made without an associated subject `profileId`. Each address is mapped to a `profileId` in the `profileIdByAddress` mapping, including mock profiles.

The [documentation from `EthosVote.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVote.sol#L22C34-L22C38) states:

> The EthosVote contract enables users to upvote or downvote any Ethos activity item

The problem is that `voteFor()` checks via `targetExistsAndAllowedForId(targetId)` if the entity we're trying to vote for _(mock profile)_ exists. The `targetExistsAndAllowedForId()` function in `EthosProfile.sol` checks if the account exists in the `profiles` mapping and `profile.createdAt` is not zero.

```solidity
137: function voteFor(address targetContract, uint256 targetId, bool isUpvote)
        external
        whenNotPaused
        isValidTarget(targetContract)
    {
  ðŸ“Œ   (bool exists,) = ITargetStatus(targetContract).targetExistsAndAllowedForId(targetId);

        if (!exists) {
            revert TargetNotFound(targetContract, targetId);
        }

        ...
    }
```

```solidity

        Profile storage profile = profiles[targetId];

    ðŸ“Œ  exist = profile.createdAt > 0;
        allowed = exist;
    }
```

[_EthosProfile.sol#490_](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L490)

The problem is that `profile.createdAt` is only updated to `block.timestamp` whilst creating an actual profile, meaning mock profiles will always have `profile.createdAt` equal to zero. Which is wrong, as mock profiles should be allowed to receive votes by design.

### Root Cause

The `targetExistsAndAllowedForId()` function in `EthosProfile` checks if the target profile exists by using the `createdAt` field instead of checking if `profileId > 0 && profileId < profileCount`

```solidity
485: function targetExistsAndAllowedForId(uint256 targetId) external view returns (bool exist, bool allowed) {
        Profile storage profile = profiles[targetId];

    ðŸ“Œ  exist = profile.createdAt > 0;
        allowed = exist;
    }
```

[_EthosProfile.sol#490_](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L490)

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Create a mock profile by leaving a review for a non-existing address that is not associated with a profile.
2. Attempt to vote for the mock profile using `voteFor()`.
3. Transaction will revert because the target profile "does not exist" based on the `createdAt` field, although it actually does.

### Impact

Mock profiles cannot receive votes or comments, which is not the intended behavior.

### PoC

Place this code in `EthosVote.test.ts`, under the `describe('voteFor')` section:

```typescript
// eslint-disable-next-line jest/no-focused-tests
it.only('should require target to be a verified profile', async () => {
  const {
    OWNER,
    ADMIN,
    ethosVote,
    ethosReview,
    ethosProfile,
    REVIEW_CREATOR_0,
    REVIEW_SUBJECT_0,
    VOTER_0,
  } = await loadFixture(deployFixture);

  await ethosProfile.connect(OWNER).inviteAddress(REVIEW_CREATOR_0.address);
  await ethosProfile.connect(REVIEW_CREATOR_0).createProfile(1);

  await ethosProfile.connect(OWNER).inviteAddress(VOTER_0.address);
  await ethosProfile.connect(VOTER_0).createProfile(1);

  // reviews can be created for mock profiles
  await addReview(ADMIN, REVIEW_CREATOR_0, REVIEW_SUBJECT_0, ethosReview);

  // assert that REVIEW_SUBJECT_0 is a mock profile (not verified)
  const status = await ethosProfile.profileStatusByAddress(REVIEW_SUBJECT_0.address);
  const mockProfileId = status[3];
  expect(status[2]).to.be.equal(true); // isMock = true
  expect(status[0]).to.be.equal(false); // isVerified = false

  const TARGET_CONTRACT = await ethosProfile.getAddress();
  const IS_UPVOTE = true;

  // will revert because target is a mock profile
  await expect(
    ethosVote.connect(VOTER_0).voteFor(TARGET_CONTRACT, mockProfileId, IS_UPVOTE),
  ).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(ethosVote, 'TargetNotFound');

  // after verification, the vote will succeed
  await ethosProfile.connect(OWNER).inviteAddress(REVIEW_SUBJECT_0.address);
  await ethosProfile.connect(REVIEW_SUBJECT_0).createProfile(1);

  // assert that REVIEW_SUBJECT_0 is a verified profile
  const statusAfter = await ethosProfile.profileStatusByAddress(REVIEW_SUBJECT_0.address);
  const verifiedProfileId = statusAfter[3];
  expect(statusAfter[2]).to.be.equal(false); // isMock = false
  expect(statusAfter[0]).to.be.equal(true); // isVerified = true

  // this will pass, proving that there is an inconsistency between reviews and votes
  // where reviews can be created for mock profiles, but votes cannot
  await ethosVote.connect(VOTER_0).voteFor(TARGET_CONTRACT, verifiedProfileId, IS_UPVOTE);
});
```

</details>

### Mitigation

Update `targetExistsAndAllowedForId()`@`EthosProfile.sol` as follows:

```solidity
    function targetExistsAndAllowedForId(uint256 targetId) external view returns (bool exist, bool allowed) {
        (verified, archived, mock) = profileStatusById(targetId);
    ðŸ“Œ  exist = (verified || mock) && !archived;
        allowed = exist;
    }
```
