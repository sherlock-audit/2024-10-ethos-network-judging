# User will get same hash when attestation details are modified slightly

### Summary

The hash for creating attestation encodes multiple string based values into a bytes object before hashing it.

However the problem comes when the string manipulation like
~ service : "ABC" , evidence: "D"
can be put as 
~ service : "AB", evidence : "CD"

```solidity
@> return keccak256(abi.encodePacked(profileId, randValue, account, service, evidence));

@> return keccak256(abi.encodePacked(service, account));
```
and get the same hash as the `abi.encodePacked` method is used.

### Root Cause

the `abi.encodePacked` method clubs all the strings together, so basic manipulation like these may lead to the same for **ServiceAndAccountHash** and **CreateAttestation**

### Impact

Hash conflict can be easily created affecting mapping storage variables like `attestationByHash` for its integrity.

### Mitigation

use `abi.encode` for group of dynamic data types like bytes and strings.
