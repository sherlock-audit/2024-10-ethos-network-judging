# Stale Mapping Entry Not Deleted in `hashIndexByProfileIdAndHash` When Removing Attestation from Previous Profile

### Summary

In `EthosAttestation.sol`, during the `_removeAttestationFromPreviousProfile` function, when an attestation is claimed by a new profile, the corresponding entry in `hashIndexByProfileIdAndHash` for the previous profile is not deleted. This oversight leads to stale mapping entries, which can cause incorrect index retrieval, data corruption, and unauthorized access to attestations. Attackers could exploit this flaw to manipulate data or interfere with other users' attestations, posing a significant risk to the protocol's integrity and user security.

### Root Cause

In `EthosAttestation.sol` at [_removeAttestationFromPreviousProfile: 498](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L498) function after removing the attestation hash from the `attestationHashesByProfileId[profileId]` array, the code fails to delete the corresponding entry in `hashIndexByProfileIdAndHash[profileId][attestationHash]`. This results in stale indices that no longer point to valid data, causing potential errors and security vulnerabilities.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. An attestation associated with `profileId 100` exists in both `attestationHashesByProfileId` and `hashIndexByProfileIdAndHash`.
2. Another user with `profileId 101` claims the attestation.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User with `profileId 101` claims the attestation, triggering `_removeAttestationFromPreviousProfile`.
2. The function removes the attestation hash from `attestationHashesByProfileId[profileId 100]` but does not delete the mapping entry.
3. The stale mapping points to an invalid index.
4. An attacker could use this stale mapping to access or manipulate data associated with `profileId 100`, potentially affecting other attestations.
4. Functions relying on this mapping such as `getAttestationIndexByProfileIdAndHash` may behave unpredictably, leading to unauthorized actions or data corruption.

### Impact

1. Unauthorized Access: Attackers may exploit stale mappings to access or alter attestations belonging to other users.
2. Data Corruption: Incorrect indices can cause data overwrites or loss, compromising the integrity of the attestation records.
3. Denial of Service: Functions may revert due to invalid indices, disrupting services for legitimate users.
4. Security Vulnerabilities: The inconsistent state opens avenues for further exploits and undermines system security.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Delete Stale Mapping Entries: After removing the attestation hash from the `attestationHashesByProfileId` array, add a line to delete the stale mapping entry in `hashIndexByProfileIdAndHash`. Reference how similar clean-up is handled in other functions or standard practices.

Updated `_removeAttestationFromPreviousProfile` Function:

```solidity
function _removeAttestationFromPreviousProfile(
    uint256 profileId,
    bytes32 attestationHash
) private {
    bytes32[] storage hashes = attestationHashesByProfileId[profileId];
    uint256 length = hashes.length;
    uint256 prevIndex = getAttestationIndexByProfileIdAndHash(profileId, attestationHash);

    if (length > 1) {
        // Replace the hash being removed with the last hash in the array
        bytes32 lastHash = hashes[length - 1];
        hashes[prevIndex] = lastHash;
        // Update the index of the last hash in the array to the index of the hash being removed
        hashIndexByProfileIdAndHash[profileId][lastHash] = prevIndex;
    }

    // Remove the last hash from the array
    hashes.pop();

    /// @dev: Delete the stale mapping entry
    delete hashIndexByProfileIdAndHash[profileId][attestationHash];
}
```

**Explanation**:

1. Replace Removed Hash: If there are multiple hashes, replace the removed hash with the last one in the array and update its index.
2. Delete Stale Entry: After updating the array and indices, delete the stale entry for the removed hash to prevent incorrect references.

Maintain Data Consistency: Ensure that all related data structures are consistently updated or cleaned up to prevent stale references.
