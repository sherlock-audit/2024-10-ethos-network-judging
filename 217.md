# Possiblity of Unexpectedly Claiming an Existent Attestation Due to Hash Collision in Attestation Creation Process

**Description**

if we examine the [getServiceAndAccountHash()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L422-L436) function, we see that it uses [abi.encodePacked()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L435) to hash the attestation [service](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L429) and [account](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L430) to produce [attestationHash](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L202).

A hash collision can occur when hashing dynamic values with `abi.encodePacked()`, which may result in two different `attestation service` and `attestation account` combinations producing the same hash.

This situation could lead to an unintentional claim of an existing attestation when a user attempts to create a new attestation by calling the [EthosAttestation::createAttestation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L176-L260) function and user will be unable to create attestation about desired service and account.

**Impact**

The use of `abi.encodePacked()` with dynamic data types in the `getServiceAndAccountHash()` function raises the risk of hash collisions. This could allow two different combinations of `attestation service` and `attestation account` to generate identical attestationHash values. If such a collision occurs, a user attempting to create a new attestation may unintentionally claim an existing attestation belonging to another user.

This issue can lead to unintended attestation claims, potentially causing confusion, data integrity issues, as it disrupts the intended uniqueness of attestations.

**Recommended mitigation**

use `abi.encode()` instead of [abi.encodePacked()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L435) inside the `getServiceAndAccountHash()` function.
