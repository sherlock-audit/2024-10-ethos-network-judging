# Unrestricted payment fee setting allows setting low fees and enabling potential spam and storage bloat attacks

### Summary

The setReviewPrice() function allows the contract owner to set the review fee (price) to any arbitrary amount without restrictions, including very low or near-zero values. If the fee is set too low, it can make the contract vulnerable to spam attacks and storage bloat from malicious users who could submit numerous reviews or repeatedly call addReview() without incurring meaningful costs..

### Root Cause

The setReviewPrice() function allows the owner to configure the review price (price) without any minimum or maximum constraints, making it possible to set a very low fee for adding reviews.

### Internal pre-conditions

The EthosReview contract has an owner account with the ability to configure fees for submitting reviews using setReviewPrice().

### External pre-conditions

An attacker has access to the contract and can afford minimal fees (if set low by the owner) to create multiple reviews or submit large data payloads repeatedly.

### Attack Path

An attacker exploits low fee by calling addReview() multiple times, spamming the contract with reviews. Each call incurs minimal cost, making it easy to overwhelm the contract with reviews.

### Impact

 - Cumulative storage requirements increase significantly, leading to increased gas costs for each interaction.
 - Legitimate users face higher costs and degraded user experience due to storage bloat and spam.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Set Minimum and Maximum Fee Limits in setReviewPrice().
```solidity
function setReviewPrice(bool allowed, address paymentToken, uint256 price) external onlyAdmin {
+    require(price >= MIN_PRICE && price <= MAX_PRICE, "Price out of bounds");
     ...
}
```
