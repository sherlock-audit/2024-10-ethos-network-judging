# `replyCount` starts at zero will create data inconsistency across Ethos Network

### Summary

The `replyCount` variable in `EthosDiscussion` starts at `zero`, which is inconsistent with other contracts in the Ethos Network where similar counters begin at one. This inconsistency can lead to potential data discrepancies across the network and may cause unintended behavior in functions that assume a count starting from one. As a result, users interacting with replies across different Ethos modules may experience unexpected behavior, and downstream processes relying on consistent data assumptions might be impacted.

### Root Cause

In the [EthosDiscussion.sol: 81](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosDiscussion.sol#L63) contract, the `replyCount` variable initializes at zero instead of one, unlike other Ethos contracts.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `replyCount` is initialized at zero in the initialize function.
2. Functions in other contracts may rely on counters starting at one to perform actions based on consistency across counters.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The initialize function is called, and `replyCount` is set to zero.
2. When users interact with replies, the ID begins from zero.
3. Any functions that expect a `replyCount` starting from one may encounter issues with checks, validations, or data retrieval, as they could expect reply IDs to align with a standard offset.

### Impact

This inconsistency in counter initialization across Ethos contracts may lead to data inconsistencies, unexpected user experiences, and potential integration issues between Ethos modules.



### PoC

### Mitigation

Initialize `replyCount` to one in `EthosDiscussion` to align with the approach used in other contracts across the Ethos Network. This simple change will improve consistency and ensure that all modules using counters behave in a standardized manner.

Initiate `replyCount` as `1` in [Initialize Function: 85](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosDiscussion.sol#L85)

+ replyCount = 1;
