# Profile Association Check Missing in `registerAddress` Function

### Summary

The `EthosProfile::registerAddress` function, designed to allow users to register a new address to a profile they are associated with, lacks a crucial verification step. It does not verify if the caller (msg.sender) is indeed associated with the `profileId` to which they are attempting to register an address. As a result, any user can register an address under a profile they do not belong to, potentially leading to unauthorized associations and impersonation risks.

### Root Cause

The function lacks a check to ensure that `msg.sender` belongs to the `profileId` they are trying to register an address for. Without this check, any user can arbitrarily add addresses to profiles they do not control.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A user has an existing profile with a valid `profileId`.
2. The `EthosProfile::registerAddress` function should check that the caller (`msg.sender`) owns or is linked to the profile before allowing a new address to be registered.

### External pre-conditions

1. Any address associated to a valid profile can call `EthosProfile::registerAddress`, passing any `profileId` without needing to belong to that profile.
2. The system does not enforce ownership of `profileId` by `msg.sender`, allowing unauthorized users to add addresses to arbitrary profiles.

### Attack Path

1. A user calls `EthosProfile::registerAddress` with the profileId of a profile they do not own.
2. The user successfully registers an address to the victim’s profile, potentially misleading others into believing that the address is associated with the victim’s profile.
3. This could lead to impersonation, account misrepresentation, and potential compromise of the profile’s reputation.

### Impact

This vulnerability enables unauthorized users to register arbitrary addresses to any profile, compromising the integrity of profile ownership and security. It opens the door to impersonation and the unauthorized association of accounts with profiles.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a check to verify that `msg.sender` is associated with the `profileId` they’re trying to register an address for. This can be achieved by calling a function that confirms msg.sender’s association with the profile before allowing them to add a new address.

```solidity
bool senderBelongsToProfile = IEthosProfile(_getEthosProfile()).addressBelongsToProfile(
      msg.sender,
      profileId
    );

    if (!senderBelongsToProfile) {
      revert UnauthorizedAddressRegistration(msg.sender, profileId);
    }
```
