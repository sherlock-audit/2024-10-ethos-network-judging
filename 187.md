# Incorrect Argument Passed in WrongPaymentAmount Error for ERC20 Payments .

### Summary:
The `_handlePayment` function passes an incorrect argument in the `WrongPaymentAmount` error `when handling ERC20 token payments` . Specifically, it provides address(0) as the payment token in the error message, rather than the actual ERC20 token address. This can mislead users and cause confusion about the payment issue.

### Vulnerability Details:
In the _handlePayment function, when processing ERC20 token payments, if the user sends ETH along with the transaction (msg.value > 0), the function should revert with an error indicating the wrong payment amount. However, instead of passing the ERC20 token address as the first argument in the WrongPaymentAmount error, it mistakenly passes address(0). This error message suggests that the issue is with an ETH payment instead of an ERC20 payment, causing potential misunderstandings about which token is involved in the error.
### Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosReview.sol#L488
```
 function _handlePayment(address paymentToken) private onlyValidPaymentToken(paymentToken) {
    uint256 price = reviewPrice[paymentToken].price;

    if (price > 0) {
      if (paymentToken == address(0)) {
        if (msg.value != price) {
          revert WrongPaymentAmount(paymentToken, msg.value);
        }
      } else {
        if (msg.value > 0) {
          // @audit-issue : wrong argument is passed.
          revert WrongPaymentAmount(address(0), msg.value);
        }
        IERC20(paymentToken).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), price);
      }
    }
  }

```

### Impact:
The incorrect argument in the error message can lead to confusion for users trying to make ERC20 payments. If they see address(0) as the payment token in the error, they might mistakenly think they need to send ETH instead of the ERC20 token, which could disrupt user experience and lead to unnecessary support requests or failed transactions.

### Recommendation:
Update the WrongPaymentAmount error call to pass the correct ERC20 token address (paymentToken) instead of address(0) when handling ERC20 payments. This ensures that users receive accurate information when they attempt a payment with the wrong amount, reducing confusion.
```
 function _handlePayment(address paymentToken) private onlyValidPaymentToken(paymentToken) {
    uint256 price = reviewPrice[paymentToken].price;

    if (price > 0) {
      if (paymentToken == address(0)) {
        if (msg.value != price) {
          revert WrongPaymentAmount(paymentToken, msg.value);
        }
      } else {
        if (msg.value > 0) {
         --  revert WrongPaymentAmount(address(0), msg.value);
        ++  revert WrongPaymentAmount(paymentToken, msg.value);
        }
        IERC20(paymentToken).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), price);
      }
    }
  }


```
