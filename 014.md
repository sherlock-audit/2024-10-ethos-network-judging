# The [`SignatureControl::validateAndSaveSignature`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network-tejas-warambhe/blob/667cfb1a224f563989b2d108ba2416d0cd3fdbaa/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/utils/SignatureControl.sol#L53) function allows signature replay upon change of `expectedSigner` by admin

### Summary

The [`SignatureControl::validateAndSaveSignature`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/utils/SignatureControl.sol#L53) function saves signature as a mechanism to avoid signature replay attacks, but when an admin decides to update the `expectedSigner` using the [`AccessControl::updateExpectedSigner`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/utils/AccessControl.sol#L113) function, it would allow anyone to use the payload which was used in past as the message hash does not contain anything like `expectedSigner` address or nonces which allows an emulation of signature replay in [`EthosAttestation::createAttestation`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L184)
```solidity
  function createAttestation(
    uint256 profileId,
    uint256 randValue,
    AttestationDetails calldata attestationDetails,
    string calldata evidence,
    bytes calldata signature
  ) external whenNotPaused {
    validateAndSaveSignature(
      _keccakForCreateAttestation( // Creates a hash without considering anything from the current expectedSigner
        profileId,
        randValue,
        attestationDetails.account,
        attestationDetails.service,
        evidence
      ),
      signature
    );
    // Rest of the code
}
```
and [`EthosProfile::registerAddress`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L373) 
```solidity
  function registerAddress(
    address addressStr,
    uint256 profileId,
    uint256 randValue,
    bytes calldata signature
  ) external whenNotPaused onlyNonZeroAddress(addressStr) {
       // Rest of the code
    validateAndSaveSignature(
      _keccakForRegisterAddress(addressStr, profileId, randValue), // Creates a hash without considering anything from the current expectedSigner
      signature
    );
   // Rest of the code
  }
```


### Root Cause

The functions [`EthosProfile::_keccakForRegisterAddress`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L399) and  [`EthosAttestation::_keccakForCreateAttestation`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L192) lacks a differentiator that allows expected signer to be linked with the hash in some way in order to prevent same payload being used when `expectedSigner` is changed by admin.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Attacker interacts with protocol as a normal user by performing activities such as creating attestation and register address.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. As soon as attacker realises that the expected signer was changed, he will use the old payload as now the signature would be different as new `expectedSigner` signs the message in the off-chain mechanism.
2. This will allow him corrupt data via`EthosAttestation::createAttestation` and `EthosProfile::registerAddress`.

### Impact

This allows emulation of signature replay attack.
This would lead to data being override / inconsistent storage via both `EthosAttestation::createAttestation` and `EthosProfile::registerAddress`function.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

It is recommended to add`expectedSigner` address while creating hash.
