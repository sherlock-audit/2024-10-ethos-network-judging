# Same address can be registered more than once for profile, leading to incorrect contract state

### Summary

In Ethos's protocol, users can register addresses to their profile via the [`registerAddress`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L373-L409) function in the [`EthosProfile.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol) contract. However, this function has a flaw, allowing users to mistakenly register the same address more than once. This results in an incorrect contract state that cannot be reversed.

### Root Cause

This issue happens because there are no checks in the [`registerAddress`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L373-L409) function to prevent users from registering the same address more than once.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Besides causing an incorrect contract state, this issue also leads to unfair limitations, since the user will no longer be able to reach the maximum allowable addresses.

### PoC

Here's a complete Proof of Concept:

```javascript
import { type HardhatEthersSigner } from '@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers/signers';
import { loadFixture } from '@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox/network-helpers';
import { expect } from 'chai';
import { createDeployer, type EthosDeployer } from '../utils/deployEthos';
import { type EthosUser } from '../utils/ethosUser';
import { type EthosProfile } from '../../typechain-types';
import { common } from '../utils/common';
import { type ContractTransactionResponse } from 'ethers';

describe("Registering the same address twice for the same profile", () => {
    let deployer: EthosDeployer;
    let ethosProfile: EthosProfile;
    let bob: EthosUser;
    let EXPECTED_SIGNER: HardhatEthersSigner;

    beforeEach(async () => {
        deployer = await loadFixture(createDeployer);
        ethosProfile = deployer.ethosProfile.contract;
        EXPECTED_SIGNER = deployer.EXPECTED_SIGNER;
        bob = await deployer.createUser();
    });

    async function registerAddress(
        user: EthosUser,
        address: string,
    ): Promise<ContractTransactionResponse> {
        const randValue = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000000);
        const signature = await common.signatureForRegisterAddress(
            address,
            user.profileId.toString(),
            randValue.toString(),
            EXPECTED_SIGNER,
        );
        return await ethosProfile
            .connect(user.signer)
            .registerAddress(address, user.profileId, randValue, signature);
    }

    it("Asserting that an address can be registered more than once for the same profile", async () => {
        // Registering the same address for Bob's profile
        await registerAddress(bob, bob.signer.address);

        // Get Bob's profile
        let bobProfile = await ethosProfile.getProfile(bob.profileId);
        // Asserting that Bob's profile has now two addresses
        expect(bobProfile.addresses.length).to.be.equal(2);
        // Asserting that Bob's profile has the same address registered more than once
        expect(bobProfile.addresses[0]).to.be.equal(bobProfile.addresses[1]);
    });
});
```

> **Instructions** to run the test:
> 1. Create a test file named `address.compromised.issue.test.ts` under the `test/profile/` folder.
> 2. Copy the PoC code snippet above into the file created in step 1.
> 3. Run the test by typing `npx hardhat test test/profile/address.compromised.issue.test.ts` in your terminal.

### Mitigation

Consider checking in the [`registerAddress`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L373-L409) function whether an address is already registered and has not been removed during address registration, to prevent users from mistakenly registering the same address more than once.
