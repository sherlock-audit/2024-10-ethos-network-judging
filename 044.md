# Unintended ETH Payment Allowed for Zero-Priced Reviews

### Summary

The absence of a check for `msg.value` when `price == 0` in the `_handlePayment` function allows users to send an arbitrary amount of ETH. Consequently, users can spend more than the intended price, creating an opportunity for excessive, unintended payments when adding reviews if the payment price is set to zero.

### Root Cause

- In `_handlePayment(address paymentToken)`, there is a missing `msg.value` validation for cases where `price` is zero and `paymentToken == address(0)`:
- In cases where the review price is set to zero, there is no restriction on the amount of ETH that users can send in `msg.value`.
- Example: `addReview()` will allow an arbitrary ETH payment if `paymentToken` is `address(0)` and `price` is zero.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The protocol admin sets `reviewPrice[address(0)].price` to zero for the native ETH payment option in the `initialize` function.
2. Users call `addReview()` and choose `address(0)` as `paymentToken`, intending to pay with ETH.
3. `msg.value` is allowed to carry any amount since the `_handlePayment` function does not check `msg.value` when `price == 0`.

### External pre-conditions

1. The protocol must allow `address(0)` as a valid token (for native ETH payments).
2. Users ETH balances need to be sufficient to send arbitrary amounts in `msg.value`.

### Attack Path

1. The protocol admin sets the price for reviews to zero for the native token (`address(0)`).
2. A user calls `addReview()` and chooses to pay with ETH, setting `paymentToken` to `address(0)` and passing any positive `msg.value`.
3. The review is accepted, even though the user paid more than required, resulting in an unintended overpayment.

### Impact

The protocol experiences unintended ETH overpayments when users submit reviews with `paymentToken` set to `address(0)` and `price` set to zero. This results in potentially excessive and arbitrary ETH loss for users due to the lack of a strict check on `msg.value` when no payment is required.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a `msg.value == 0` check within _handlePayment to enforce that no ETH is sent if the price for `address(0)` is zero.
