# `removedAddresses` Array Can Contain Non-Compromised Addresses Due to Incorrect Implementation of `_deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray()` Function

**Description**

The [removedAddresses](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/interfaces/IEthosProfile.sol#L13) array is intended to store compromised addresses that are added when a registered address is removed from a ethos profile.

However, due to the current implementation of the [EthosProfile::_deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L578-L593) function, non-compromised addresses are added to `removedAddresses` instead.

To remove a registered address from a profile using the [EthosProfile::deleteAddressAtIndex()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L411-L438) function, the internal `_deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray()` function performs the following steps:

1. Retrieves the `last address` of the addresses array.
2. Replaces the `last address` at the index of the compromised address.
3. Adds the `last address` to the `removedAddresses` array.
4. Removes the `last address` from the `addresses` array after replacing it at the compromised addressâ€™s index.

This results in the `last address` existing in both the `addresses` (active registered addresses) and `removedAddresses` (compromised addresses) arrays.

Instead, the compromised address (the address being unregistered) should be added to the `removedAddresses` array.

**Impact**

This issue disrupts the expectation that all addresses in the `removedAddresses` array are compromised.

Due to the incorrect implementation of `_deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray()`, active registered addresses can appear in both `addresses` and `removedAddresses` simultaneously.

Consequently, the `removedAddresses` array lacks accurate historical data, preventing reliable tracking of `compromised addresses`.

**Recommended Mitigation**

Refactor the `_deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray()` function to add the `compromised address` to the `removedAddresses` array:

```diff
  function _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray(
    uint256 index,
    address[] storage addresses,
    address[] storage removedAddresses
  ) private {
+   address compromisedAddr = addresses[index];
    address addr = addresses[addresses.length - 1];
    addresses[index] = addr;
-   removedAddresses.push(addr);
+   removedAddresses.push(compromisedAddr);
    addresses.pop();
  }
```
