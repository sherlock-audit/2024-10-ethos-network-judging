# Review Author is Allowed to Leave Self Reviews Due to Missing Validation in `EthosReview::_validateReviewDetails()` Leading to Breaking the Core Invariant


**Description**

If we examine the [EthosReview::_validateReviewDetails()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosReview.sol#L496-L544) function, it prevents the review author from leaving self-reviews.

However, a critical check is missing:

the function does not ensure that the individual leaving the review wasn’t invited by the subject profileId or attestation profileId, which enables the attestation creator or subject creator to invite alternate wallet addresses, then set up profiles, and leave positive self-reviews, undermining the integrity of the review system and gaining reputation and credibility score.

**Impact**

The missing validation allows malicious actors to manipulate the review system by creating and controlling multiple profiles that can leave self-authored reviews.

This not only damages the credibility of the Ethos Network’s reputation and review mechanisms, but also compromises the core invariant designed to prevent self-reviews.

this could erode trust among users and create a system open to exploitation, as bad actors can artificially inflate or manipulate reviews in their favor to gain more reputation and credibility.

**Recommended mitigation**

Implement an additional check within `_validateReviewDetails()` function, to ensure the one leaving reviews for an attestation or subject, is not invited by the same attestation creator profileId or subject creator profileId.

```diff
  function _validateReviewDetails(
    address subject,
    AttestationDetails calldata attestationDetails
  ) private view {


    // ignore code above this block
 

    uint256 authorProfileId = _getEthosProfile().profileIdByAddress(msg.sender);
+   IEthosProfile.Profile memory authorProfileDetails = _getEthosProfile().getProfile(authorProfileId);
    if (subject != address(0)) {
      // if reviewing by address, check if the author's profile is the same as the subject's profile
      uint256 subjectProfileId = _getEthosProfile().profileIdByAddress(subject);
      if (authorProfileId == subjectProfileId) {
        revert SelfReview(subject);
      }

+     if (authorProfileDetails.inviteInfo.invitedBy == subjectProfileId) {
+         revert SelfReview(subject);
+     }

    } else {
      // if reviewing by attestation, check if the author's profile is the same as the subject's profile
      bytes32 attestationHash = _getEthosAttestation().getServiceAndAccountHash(
        attestationDetails.service,
        attestationDetails.account
      );
      uint256 subjectProfileId = _getEthosProfile().profileIdByAttestation(attestationHash);
      if (authorProfileId == subjectProfileId) {
        revert SelfReview(subject);
      }

+     if (authorProfileDetails.inviteInfo.invitedBy == subjectProfileId) {
+         revert SelfReview(subject);
+     }
    }

  }
```

This will prevent users from inviting their own alternate accounts to leave self reviews.
