# Use call instead of transfer for withdrawals.

### Summary

[EthosReview::withdrawFunds()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosReview.sol#L449) currently uses transfer to send Ether to the `onlyOwner`. 
The transfer function imposes a fixed gas limit of 2300 gas for the transfer, 
which can lead to transaction failures if the recipient is a contract and executes 
some custom logic on `fallback()` or `receive()`.

### Attack Path

### Impact

Gnosis Safe multisig wallets, as well as other smart contract wallets, generally 
require more than 2300 gas due to their internal operations. 

This issue could lead to failed withdrawals by the contract owner due to the gas limit restriction. 
If the transfer fails, the contract owner will be unable to retrieve Ether stored in the contract. 

Note: I'm adding this as medium as team, declared that they are planning to use 
a multisig for `onlyOwner`.


### PoC

### Mitigation

To ensure successful withdrawals and avoid issues related to the fixed gas limit, replace transfer with call, which allows specifying a custom gas limit. This approach is more flexible and compatible with smart contract wallets like Gnosis Safe.

```solidity
  /**
   * @dev Withdraws funds.
   * @param paymentToken Payment token address.
   */
  function withdrawFunds(address paymentToken) external onlyOwner {
    if (paymentToken == address(0)) {
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: address(this).balance}("");
        require(success, "Ether transfer failed");
    } else {
      IERC20(paymentToken).transfer(msg.sender, IERC20(paymentToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }
  }
```
