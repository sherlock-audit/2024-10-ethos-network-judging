# User can register an existing address in profile id to a profile id then delete one, allowing it to be removed and active at the same time

### Summary

Register Address function can be called for an address that is already registered for the profile id.
This allows duplicates to exist in the `profiles[].addresses` array.

When the user tries to delete it, it can exist in the `profiles[].removedAddresses` as well as the `profiles[].addresses` array.

This means that the address is both [active and removed](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L394), confusing offchain view functions like `addressesForProfile`, `checkIsAddressCompromised`, `addressBelongsToProfile`



### Root Cause

Duplicate entries are allowed in `profiles[].addresses` causing this scenario.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User calls `registerAddress` for address `A`
2. User mistakenly re-calls `registerAddress` for the same address `A`
3. User decides to remove `A` and calls `deleteAddressAtIndex` for index 1

### Impact

Off chain components are confused and a logical fallacy exists by an address existing both as active and removed

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Check for address existing already when trying to register a new address
