# Attestation's `profileId` Not Updated in `attestationById` Mapping When Attestation is Claimed

### Summary

In `EthosAttestation.sol`, when an attestation is claimed by a new profile through the `_claimAttestation` function, the `profileId` is updated in the `attestationByHash` mapping but not in the `attestationById` mapping. This inconsistency leads to a critical security vulnerability where functions relying on `attestationById` such as `targetExistsAndAllowedForId` or using on frontend will use outdated `profileId` information. As a result, unauthorized users may gain control over attestations, and rightful/claimed owners may lose access, compromising the core protocol's integrity and potentially causing significant disruption.

### Root Cause

In [EthosAttestation.sol: 207](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L207), within the `_claimAttestation` function at [Line: 269](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L269), the `profileId` is updated in `attestationByHash` but not in `attestationById`. This mismatch causes any access control or validation mechanisms that depend on `attestationById` to make decisions based on incorrect `profileId`, leading to unauthorized actions.

At [CreateAttestation: 247](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L247) it updates `atttestationById` but not updating after claiming attestation!

### Internal pre-conditions

1. An attestation exists with a specific `attestationId` and `attestationHash`, associated with `profileId 100` in both `attestationByHash` and `attestationById` mappings.
2. Another user with `profileId 101` intends to claim the existing attestation.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A user with `profileId 100` creates an attestation, which is stored in both `attestationByHash` and `attestationById` mappings.
2. Another user with `profileId 101` calls `createAttestation` with the same service and account details, triggering the `_claimAttestation` function because the attestation already exists.
3. The `_claimAttestation` function updates `attestationByHash[attestationHash].profileId` to `profileId 101`.
4. The `attestationById[attestationId]` mapping still holds the old `profileId 100` because it was not updated.
5. Any functions or users accessing `attestationById[attestationId]` retrieve the outdated `profileId 100`, leading to inconsistent and potentially insecure behavior.

### Impact

1. Unauthorized Access: Attackers could gain control over attestations they do not own, leading to identity theft or impersonation.
2. Loss of Control: Legitimate users may lose the ability to manage their attestations, including archiving or restoring them.
3. Data Integrity Compromise: Core protocol data becomes unreliable, undermining trust in the system.
4. Security Breach: Potential for further exploits if functions assume incorrect ownership based on outdated data.
5. Reputational Damage: Loss of user confidence due to perceived insecurity of the platform.

### Mitigation

Update `attestationById` Mapping in `_claimAttestation`: Referencing the `createAttestation` function, where both `attestationByHash` and `attestationById` mappings are updated when an attestation is created, we should apply the same approach in `_claimAttestation`.

In the createAttestation function, the mappings are updated as follows:

```solidity
attestationByHash[hashStr] = Attestation({
    archived: false,
    attestationId: attestationCount,
    createdAt: block.timestamp,
    profileId: profileId,
    account: attestationDetails.account,
    service: attestationDetails.service
});
attestationById[attestationCount] = attestationByHash[hashStr];
```

To ensure consistency, update both mappings in the `_claimAttestation` function:

```solidity
// Update attestationByHash mapping
attestationByHash[attestationHash].profileId = profileId;

// Update attestationById mapping
uint256 attestationId = attestationByHash[attestationHash].attestationId;
attestationById[attestationId].profileId = profileId;
```

Updated `_claimAttestation` Function:

```solidity
function _claimAttestation(
    uint256 profileId,
    bytes32 attestationHash,
    string calldata evidence
) private returns (bool) {
    if (!attestationExistsForHash(attestationHash)) {
        return false;
    }

    Attestation storage attestation = attestationByHash[attestationHash];

    if (attestation.profileId == profileId) {
        return false;
    }

    address ethosProfile = _getEthosProfile();
    (bool profileExists, ) = ITargetStatus(ethosProfile).targetExistsAndAllowedForId(profileId);

    if (!profileExists) {
        revert ProfileNotFound(profileId);
    }
    bool senderBelongsToProfile = IEthosProfile(ethosProfile).addressBelongsToProfile(
        msg.sender,
        profileId
    );

    if (!senderBelongsToProfile) {
        revert AddressNotInProfile(msg.sender, profileId);
    }

    // Remove attestation from the previous profile
    _removeAttestationFromPreviousProfile(attestation.profileId, attestationHash);

    // Set new profileId for attestation
    attestation.profileId = profileId;

    // Update attestationById mapping
    uint256 attestationId = attestation.attestationId;
    attestationById[attestationId].profileId = profileId;

    attestationHashesByProfileId[profileId].push(attestationHash);
    // Update the index of the hash in the new profile
    hashIndexByProfileIdAndHash[profileId][attestationHash] =
        attestationHashesByProfileId[profileId].length - 1;

    // Restore attestation if it was previously archived
    if (attestation.archived) {
        attestation.archived = false;
    }

    // Keep the profile contract up to date re: registered attestations
    IEthosProfile(ethosProfile).assignExistingProfileToAttestation(attestationHash, profileId);

    emit AttestationClaimed(
        attestation.attestationId,
        attestation.service,
        attestation.account,
        evidence,
        profileId
    );

    return true;
}
```

By updating both `attestationByHash` and `attestationById` mappings in the `_claimAttestation` function, we ensure that all references to the attestation reflect the new `profileId`, maintaining data consistency and security.
