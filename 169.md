# Wrong address added to the removedAddresses array field of the profile data

### Summary

When an address is removed from a profile it is added to the removedAddresses field of the profile data for historical tracking. However, the address added to the removedAddresses array is not the address being removed.

### Root Cause

Wrong address is added to the removedAddress array field of the profile data when deleting an address from a profile.

### Internal pre-conditions

- User A needs to have or be linked to a profile.
- User A needs to have more than two addresses registered to their profile.
- User A needs to be associated with the profile they want to delete an address from.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- user A creates a profile
- user A calls `registerAddress` to register account B to their profile
- user A calls `registerAddress` to register account C to their profile
- user A calls `deleteAddressAtIndex` with the index of account B to remove it from their profile
- The address added to the removedAddresses array of the profile will be account C.


### Impact

The addresses in the removedAddresses array for a profile will be incorrect, leading to wrong data being returned and used off-chain.

### PoC

```javascript
    it('POC -- address in removedAddresses not correct', async () => {
      const { ethosProfile, PROFILE_CREATOR_0, EXPECTED_SIGNER, OTHER_0, OTHER_1, OWNER } =
        await loadFixture(deployFixture);

      const profileId = String(2);
      let rand = '123';
      let signature = await common.signatureForRegisterAddress(
        OTHER_0.address,
        profileId,
        rand,
        EXPECTED_SIGNER,
      );

      await ethosProfile.connect(OWNER).inviteAddress(PROFILE_CREATOR_0.address);
      await ethosProfile.connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0).createProfile(1);
      await ethosProfile
        .connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0)
        .registerAddress(OTHER_0.address, profileId, rand, signature);

      rand = '456';
      signature = await common.signatureForRegisterAddress(
        OTHER_1.address,
        profileId,
        rand,
        EXPECTED_SIGNER,
      );
      await ethosProfile
        .connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0)
        .registerAddress(OTHER_1.address, profileId, rand, signature);

      let addresses = await ethosProfile.addressesForProfile(2);
      expect(addresses.length).to.be.equal(3, 'should be 3 addresses');

      // delete address at index 1
      await ethosProfile.connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0).deleteAddressAtIndex(1);

      addresses = await ethosProfile.addressesForProfile(2);
      expect(addresses.length).to.be.equal(2, 'should be 2 addresses');
      expect(addresses[0]).to.be.equal(PROFILE_CREATOR_0.address, 'wrong address[0]');
      expect(addresses[1]).to.be.equal(OTHER_1.address, 'wrong address[1]');

      const removedAddresses = (await ethosProfile.getProfile(2)).removedAddresses;
      //the removedAddresses contains OTHER_1.address but the address removed is OTHER_0.address
      expect(removedAddresses[0]).to.be.equal(addresses[1]);
      expect(removedAddresses[0]).to.be.equal(OTHER_1.address);
    });

```

### Mitigation

Add the correct address being removed to the removedAddresses array

```diff
           //..... function header
+          address addressToRemove = addresses[index];
             address addr = addresses[addresses.length - 1];
              addresses[index] = addr;
-            removedAddresses.push(addr);
+           removedAddresses.push(addressToRemove);
              addresses.pop();
```
