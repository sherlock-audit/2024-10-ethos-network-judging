# Only the author address of a review can restore and archive the review.

### Summary

The `EthosReview::archiveReview` and `EthosReview::restoreReview` functions can only be called by the author address of the review, but the review is linked to the author's profile which is an issue since an address can be removed from a profile

### Root Cause

In [EthosReview::archiveReview](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosReview.sol#L300) and [EthosReview::restoreReview](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosReview.sol#L321) allowing only the author's address of a review to archive and restore the review.  

### Internal pre-conditions

- User A's profile should have more than one address registered.
- Account B registered to User A's profile authors a review on behalf of the profile
- User A removes account B from their profile

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User A registers account B by calling `EthosProfile::registerAddress` to their profile.
2. account B calls `EthosReview::addReview` and adds a review to the profile
3. account B is compromised and User A calls `EthosProfile::deleteAddressAtIndex` to remove account B
4. User A will be unable to archive the review or restore it if account B archives it meanwhile account B can still archive and restore the review for the profile they aren't associated with anymore as they are the author.

### Impact

User A will lose the capability of archiving and restoring the review as the address that authored it has been removed from the profile. While account B will still be able to archive and restore the reviews.

### PoC

```javascript
it('POC -- remove review author', async () => {
      const { ethosProfile, PROFILE_CREATOR_0, EXPECTED_SIGNER, OTHER_0, OWNER, ethosReview, OTHER_1 } =
        await loadFixture(deployFixture);

      const profileId = String(2);
      const rand = '123';
      const signature = await common.signatureForRegisterAddress(
        OTHER_0.address,
        profileId,
        rand,
        EXPECTED_SIGNER,
      );

      await ethosProfile.connect(OWNER).inviteAddress(PROFILE_CREATOR_0.address);
      await ethosProfile.connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0).createProfile(1);

      await ethosProfile
        .connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0)
        .registerAddress(OTHER_0.address, profileId, rand, signature);

      const adddresses = await ethosProfile.addressesForProfile(2);
      expect(adddresses.length).to.be.equal(2, 'should be 2 addresses');

      expect(adddresses[0]).to.be.equal(PROFILE_CREATOR_0.address, 'wrong address[0]');
      expect(adddresses[1]).to.be.equal(OTHER_0.address, 'wrong address[1]');

      const params = {
        score: Score.Positive,
        subject: OTHER_1.address,
        paymentToken: ethers.ZeroAddress,
        comment: defaultComment,
        metadata: defaultMetadata,
        attestationDetails: {
          account: '',
          service: '',
        } satisfies AttestationDetails,
      };

      await ethosReview
        .connect(OTHER_0)
        .addReview(
          params.score,
          params.subject,
          params.paymentToken,
          params.comment,
          params.metadata,
          params.attestationDetails
        );

      let review = await ethosReview.reviews(0);
      expect(review.archived).to.equal(false, 'wrong before');

      await ethosReview.connect(OTHER_0).archiveReview(0);

      review = await ethosReview.reviews(0);
      expect(review.archived).to.equal(true, 'wrong after');

      await ethosProfile.connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0).deleteAddressAtIndex(1);

      const profileCreatorAddresses = await ethosProfile.addressesForProfile(2);
      expect(profileCreatorAddresses.length).to.be.equal(1);
      expect(profileCreatorAddresses[0]).to.be.equal(PROFILE_CREATOR_0.address);
      await expect(ethosReview.connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0).restoreReview(0)).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(ethosReview, 'UnauthorizedArchiving')
      .withArgs(0);

    });
```

### Mitigation

Only addresses linked to a profile should be able to restore and archive a review on behalf of the profile.
