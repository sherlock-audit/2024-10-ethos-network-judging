# Compromise check will prevent malicious operations

### Summary

A missing compromise check in `verifiedProfileIdForAddress` will cause unauthorized access for affected contracts as compromised addresses can bypass security measures and perform malicious actions.
(e.g: Attacker can steal user's private key, so address is compromised)

### Root Cause

In `EthosProfile.sol`, the `verifiedProfileIdForAddress` function is missing a check to ensure `_address` is not compromised, allowing compromised addresses to interact with other contracts without restriction.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/979e352d7bcdba3d0665f11c0320041ce28d1b89/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L568-L574

The `verifiedProfileIdForAddress` function used in many contracts.

In this project, there are many issues about this compromised address.
In almost contracts, it doesn't check `msg.sender` is compromised address.
Address is already unregistered from profile by `deleteAddressAtIndex` function, but it is still used in many functions.

### Internal pre-conditions

User needs to call `deleteAddressAtIndex` to set `isAddressCompromised` to be true for the target address.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attack steal user's private key.
2. User detected it is compromised and calls `deleteAddressAtIndex` for marking `isAddressCompromised` as true for the target address.
3. Attacker can calls `addReview` in `EthorsReview` contract by compromised address. (private key is stolen so attacker can do this operation)
It calls `ethosProfile.verifiedProfileIdForAddress(msg.sender);` msg.sender is compromised but it doesn't revert.

### Impact

The **protocol** suffers a potential security breach as **compromised addresses** can bypass verification and execute unauthorized actions in dependent contracts, potentially leading to **manipulation of contract functionality**. The attacker gains access to otherwise restricted operations without proper authorization.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add modifier `checkIfCompromised` and use `checkIsAddressCompromised` function.
