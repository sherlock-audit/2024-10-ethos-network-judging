# Compromised User Can Still Interact With Ethos Network as a Valid User Due to Missing `profileId` Removal in `deleteAddressAtIndex()` Function

**Description**

In the Ethos Network, a user must have a verified profile to interact with the system. This can be achieved either by [creating a profile](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L152-L172) or by [registering an address](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L364-L409) to an existing profile.

When a registered address is removed from a profile using the [EthosProfile::deleteAddressAtIndex()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L411-L438) function, there is no line in place to remove the assigned `profileId` for that [addressStr](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L431).

This oversight enables `addressStr` to retain a valid, verified profile, allowing it to continue interacting with the Ethos Network.

**Impact**

removed and compromised registered address can interact with Ethos Network, meaning it can call [EthosAttestation::createAttestation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L176-L260), [EthosReview::addReview()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosReview.sol#L164-L219), [addReply()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosDiscussion.sol#L98-L145), [voteFor()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVote.sol#L131-L156) and many other functions that [require the caller to have active profile](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L568-L574).

This enables a removed user to leave negative comments or reviews, submit downvotes, create attestations, issue vouches or basically perform actions that could significantly damage the reputation and credibility score of the profile.

Furthermore, there would be no effective way to prevent the user from continuing these detrimental actions.

**Recommended mitigation**

Add the following line inside the `EthosProfile::deleteAddressAtIndex()` function to ensure that the profileId assigned to addressStr is removed:

```diff
  function deleteAddressAtIndex(uint256 addressIndex) external whenNotPaused {
    
    // ignore code before this

    address addressStr = addresses[addressIndex];
    isAddressCompromised[addressStr] = true;
    _addressShouldDifferFromSender(addressStr);

    _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray(addressIndex, addresses, removedAddresses);

+   delete profileIdByAddress[addressStr];

    emit AddressClaim(profileId, addressStr, AddressClaimStatus.Unclaimed);
  }
```
