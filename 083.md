# Unsafe usage of `transferFrom` in `EthosReview.sol`

### Summary

Some ERC20 tokens do not revert on failure but instead, return false if their transfer/transferFrom functions fail. In the case that a payment token returns false on failure, users may be able to add reviews without transferring tokens.

### Root Cause

In `_handlePayment` [`transferFrom`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosReview.sol#L491C9-L491C77) is used to receive payment tokens:
```solidity
IERC20(paymentToken).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), price);
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. There is a mandatory payment fee when adding reviews

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A token that does not revert on failure is added as a payment token.
2. User adds a review using that token but their transfer fails.
3. Even though they didn't transfer the token they successfully added the review, avoiding the necessary payment. 

### Impact

Users may be able to add reviews for free.

### Mitigation

Consider using Openzeppelin's SafeERC20 to transfer ERC20 tokens.
