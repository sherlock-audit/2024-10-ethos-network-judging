# Use of `.transfer` can cause Ether withdrawal failures, leading to funds being stuck in the contract

### Summary

In `EthosReview.sol`, the use of `.transfer` in the `withdrawFunds` function will cause Ether to become inaccessible for the owner if the owner's address is a contract that requires more than 2300 gas to accept Ether transfers. This occurs because `.transfer` imposes a fixed gas stipend of 2300, which may not be sufficient for contracts with complex fallback functions, causing the Ether transfer to fail and funds to remain locked in the contract.

Note(other finding): Use SafeERC20 Lib for ERC20 tokens!

### Root Cause

In [EthosReview.sol: 449](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosReview.sol#L449), the `withdrawFunds` function uses `payable(msg.sender).transfer(address(this).balance);`, which sends Ether with a fixed gas limit of 2300, potentially leading to failed transfers if the recipient requires more gas to process the incoming Ether.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The contract holds a non-zero Ether balance intended for withdrawal.
2. The owner calls `withdrawFunds(address(0))` to withdraw Ether from the contract.

### External pre-conditions

The owner's address is a contract (e.g., a multisig wallet or another smart contract) with a receive or fallback function that consumes more than 2300 gas.

### Attack Path

1. The owner calls the `withdrawFunds(address(0))` function to withdraw Ether.
2. The function attempts to send Ether using `.transfer`, which forwards only 2300 gas to the recipient.
3. If the owner's address is a contract that requires more than 2300 gas to execute its receive or fallback function, the transfer fails due to an out-of-gas error.
4. The transaction reverts, and the Ether remains locked in the `EthosReview` contract.
5. The owner is unable to withdraw the Ether, leading to potential loss of access to these funds.

### Impact

The owner cannot withdraw the Ether held in the contract, resulting in funds being effectively stuck and inaccessible. This can cause significant financial loss and operational issues for the owner, especially if the contract accumulates a large balance over time.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To resolve this issue, replace the use of .transfer with .call, which allows for dynamic gas forwarding and can accommodate contracts that require more than 2300 gas to receive Ether. Additionally, implement a reentrancy guard to protect against potential reentrancy attacks when using .call.

Modified Code:
```solidity
function withdrawFunds(address paymentToken) external onlyOwner {
    if (paymentToken == address(0)) {
        uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: balance}("");
        require(success, "Ether transfer failed");
    } else {
        IERC20(paymentToken).transfer(msg.sender, IERC20(paymentToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }
}
```
