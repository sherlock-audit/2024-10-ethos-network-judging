# Lack of Active Status Check Allows Archived Profiles to Claim Attestations

**Description**

In the [_claimAttestation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L262-L328) function, specifically in these [lines](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L286-L290), the code verifies that the target `profileId` exists but does not confirm that it `is not archived`. This means a user with a` disabled (archived)` Ethos profile can `claim attestations`.

Allowing an archived profile to claim attestations undermines the integrity of the Ethos network, as inactive profiles should not perform actions or accumulate attestations.

**Impact**

This vulnerability allows disabled (archived) profiles to claim attestations, which contradicts the expected behavior for inactive accounts.

Just as in Web2 platforms, where a disabled or deactivated profile is restricted from performing any actions, an archived profile in Ethos should similarly be unable to claim attestations.

Allowing an archived profile to interact with the system disrupts the intended user experience, as it bypasses the access controls expected for inactive accounts.

**Recommended mitigation**

refactor this [part](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L286-L290) of the `_claimAttestation()` function to code written below, which basically ensures caller profile is active ethos profile meaning is verified, not archived and not mock profile:

```diff
-    (bool profileExists, ) = ITargetStatus(ethosProfile).targetExistsAndAllowedForId(profileId);
- 
-    if (!profileExists) {
-      revert ProfileNotFound(profileId);
-    }
+    // ensure caller profile is active
+    IEthosProfile(ethosProfile).verifiedProfileIdForAddress(msg.sender);
```
