# Unauthorized `Invites` from `Compromised Addresses` Threaten User Credibility in `EthosProfile` Contract

### Summary

The missing check in the `EthosProfile` contract  in the function `inviteAddress` will cause a significant credibility loss for users as compromised addresses will be able to send invites to new users.

### Root Cause

In `EthosProfile.sol`, the `inviteAddress` function lacks a verification check on the sender's address to ensure it is not compromised, allowing malicious actors to exploit this oversight.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A profile must exist for the sender of the invite (the inviter).
2. The sender's address must not be marked as compromised.
3. The sender must have available invites to send.

### External pre-conditions

No external protocols or conditions are required for the invite to be sent; the attack can occur independently.

### Attack Path

1. An attacker compromises a userâ€™s address within the Ethos Network.
2. The attacker calls the inviteAddress function using the compromised address.
3. The function processes the invite without any restrictions on the sender's compromised status.
4. The invite is successfully sent to a legitimate user, potentially damaging the reputation of the compromised user's profile.

### Impact

Legitimate user profiles will be forever tied to the invited accounts which effects their credibility and reputation

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To mitigate this vulnerability, a check should be implemented in the inviteAddress function to ensure that the sender's address is not marked as compromised
