# Potential Hash Collision will cause overwrite of attestation

### Summary

There is a possibility of hash collision if the service and account data in AttestationDetails matches a previous attestation that was done previously by another profile

### Root Cause

in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L428, we see that `function getServiceAndAccountHash` returns the hash for the `hashStr` used in `createAttestation` as seen in  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L184-L232

The hashStr is used to claimAttestation as seen in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L269

It directly allows the profiled be overwritten, without a check to see if profileId is already previously claimed
```solidity
// Set new profileId for attestation
    attestationByHash[attestationHash].profileId = profileId;
    attestationHashesByProfileId[profileId].push(attestationHash);
    // Update the index of the hash in the new profile
    hashIndexByProfileIdAndHash[profileId][attestationHash] =
      attestationHashesByProfileId[profileId].length -
      1;

    // Restore attestation if it was previously archived
    if (attestationByHash[attestationHash].archived) {
      attestationByHash[attestationHash].archived = false;
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1) AttestationDetails.service data must be same
2) AttestationDetails.account must be same

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Overwriting of Previous Attestation done by a profile

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Check for a match in the `hashStr` before attempting to claim attestation in _claimAttestation
