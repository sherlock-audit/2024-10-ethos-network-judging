# Compromised Address Can Create Profile in Ethos Network and Interact with the Protocol

**Description**

Compromised Address Can Create Profile in Ethos Network and here's how:

1. We have two users, both with active profiles in the Ethos Network, let's call them `Alice` and `Bob`, and one user without a valid profile yet, named `John`.
2. `Alice` sends an invite to `John` by calling the [EthosProfile::InviteAddress()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L202-L239) function, inviting him to create a profile on the Ethos Network.
3. After the invitation is sent, `Bob` registers `John` to his profile by calling the [EthosProfile::registerAddress()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L364-L409) function. Right after registration, `Bob` deletes `John` as a registered address using the [EthosProfile::deleteAddressAtIndex()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L411-L438) function.
4. `John` is now considered a compromised address. However, since `Alice` invited `John` before, `John` can call the [EthosProfile::createProfile()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L152-L172) function and create a profile for himself on the Ethos Network as a compromised user.

**Impact**

This breaks the core invariant that compromised addresses cannot have profiles in the Ethos Network, and a compromised user will be able to interact with other parts of the Ethos Network.

**Recommended mitigation**

Refactor User Registration System in following way:

1. A `user with no profile` should first send a request to a `user that has a valid Ethos profile`, indicating that he wants to be `registered by them`.
2. Then, the `user with a valid Ethos profile` is able to register the `user with no profile`.

If the `user with no profile` hasn't sent a request to the user who wants to register him, the registration attempt should fail and `revert`.

this will prevent the malicious actor from being able to register a user and then compromising the user address.
