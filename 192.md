# Malicious Actor Can Hijack Any Profile and Compromise Remaining Users Of the Same Profile, Preventing Them from Interacting with Ethos Network And Taking Advantage of Profile Reputation For Malicious Purposes

**Description**

The user registration mechanism in the [EthosProfile::registerAddress()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L364-L409) function is implemented in a way that allows a user to register an [addressStr](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L374) to any profile without their consent. This vulnerability allows a malicious actor to:

1. Register themselves to any profile by passing their address to the [addressStr](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L374) parameter and the [profileId](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L375) of the profile they wish to hijack to the `EthosProfile::registerAddress()` function.

2. Once registered to a profile, the malicious user can delete and compromise other users of the same profile by calling the [EthosProfile::deleteAddressAtIndex()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L411-L438) function.

3. After successfully hijacking a profile and banning(compromising) other users, the malicious actor can prevent them from interacting with the Ethos Network.

Once control is established, the malicious actor can leverage the profile's reputation for their own purposes.

**Impact**

This vulnerability allows an attacker to take control of any user profile in the Ethos Network, enabling them to exploit the profile’s reputation and credibility for malicious purposes.

By hijacking a trusted profile, the attacker could conduct scams, promote illicit activities, or spread harmful content across both Web3 and Web2 spaces. Additionally, they can impersonate the profile owner, misleading other users into interacting with fraudulent links or phishing schemes.

This compromises the network's integrity, erodes user trust, and could result in financial and reputational harm for both the Ethos Network and its users.

**Recommended Mitigation**

The user registration mechanism should be revised as follows:

1. If `user1` with a valid profile wants to register `user2`, `user1` must send a *request* to `user2`, notifying them of the intent to register. If `user2` accepts, they will be registered to the profile. Otherwise, `user2` can reject the offer.

2. If `user2` wishes to be registered to a specific profile, such as `user1`’s profile, `user2` must send a *request* to `user1`’s `profileId`, notifying them of the intent to join. `user1` can then either accept the request and register `user2` or reject it.

This approach ensures that users with valid profiles cannot register other users without their consent, and users without profiles cannot register themselves to any profile without prior approval.
