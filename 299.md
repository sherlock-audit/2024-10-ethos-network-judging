# Wrong address gets deleted in `_deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray()`

### Summary

Wrong address gets deleted in `_deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray()`

### Root Cause

### Attack Path

- Whenever a user deletes an address at an index through `deleteAddressAtIndex()` it would delete wrong address.
```solidity
function deleteAddressAtIndex(uint256 addressIndex) external whenNotPaused {
    uint256 profileId = profileIdByAddress[msg.sender];
    (bool verified, bool archived, bool mock) = profileStatusById(profileId);
    if (!verified) {
      revert ProfileNotFoundForAddress(msg.sender);
    }
    if (archived || mock) {
      revert ProfileAccess(profileId, "Profile is archived");
    }

    address[] storage addresses = profiles[profileId].addresses;
    address[] storage removedAddresses = profiles[profileId].removedAddresses;
    if (addresses.length <= addressIndex) {
      revert InvalidIndex();
    }

    address addressStr = addresses[addressIndex];
    isAddressCompromised[addressStr] = true;
    _addressShouldDifferFromSender(addressStr);

    _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray(addressIndex, addresses, removedAddresses);

    emit AddressClaim(profileId, addressStr, AddressClaimStatus.Unclaimed);
  }
  ```
  - Inside `deleteAddressAtIndex()` , `_deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray(addressIndex, addresses, removedAddresses);` gets called where the problem arises.
  - This fuunction is used to delete address at given index.
  ```solidity
  function _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray(
    uint256 index,
    address[] storage addresses,
    address[] storage removedAddresses
  ) private {
    address addr = addresses[addresses.length - 1];
    addresses[index] = addr;
    removedAddresses.push(addr);
    addresses.pop();
  }
  ```
  - Here `addr` gets pushed into removedAddresses but instead `removedAddresses.push(addresses[index])` should be there.
  - Because of this wrong address gets pushed into removed Address array.
  

### Impact

Wrong gets deleted and gets pushed into removedAddress array.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add this line `removedAddresses.push(addresses[index])` instead of this ` removedAddresses.push(addr);`
