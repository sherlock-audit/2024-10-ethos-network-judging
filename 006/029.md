# UUPS Upgradeable Contracts not using OpenZeppelin Upgradeable Libraries leading to storage collisions.

### Summary

All contracts are UUPS upgradeable; however, they utilize **`openzeppelin-contracts`** instead of **`openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable`**. This can lead to storage collisions and compromise the security of the upgrade functionality.

### Root Cause

All contracts are UUPS upgradeable; for example, I will reference [EthosVote.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVote.sol#L26).
```Solidity
contract EthosVote is AccessControl, Common, UUPSUpgradeable
```
As you can see, it is UUPSUpgradeable. Letâ€™s take a closer look at [AccessControl](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/utils/AccessControl.sol).
```Solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.26;

import { IPausable } from "../interfaces/IPausable.sol";
import { IContractAddressManager } from "../interfaces/IContractAddressManager.sol";
import { Pausable } from "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Pausable.sol";
import { AccessControlEnumerable } from "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/extensions/AccessControlEnumerable.sol";
import { SignatureControl } from "./SignatureControl.sol";
import { ETHOS_INTERACTION_CONTROL } from "./Constants.sol";

/**
 * @dev Contract module that allows children to restrict access to run functions
 * by service account only.
 */
abstract contract AccessControl is IPausable, Pausable, AccessControlEnumerable, SignatureControl {}
```
As you can see, it utilizes **`@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Pausable.sol`** instead of the upgradeable version. 

This can lead to storage collisions and compromise the security of upgrades.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

None.

### Impact

Insecure upgrades and potential storage collisions.

### PoC

The preceding sections highlight the issue.

### Mitigation

Utilize the upgradeable contracts for all OpenZeppelin implementations.
