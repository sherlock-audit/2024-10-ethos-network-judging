# An archived profile can archive an attestation associated with that profile

## Summary

There is a missing check in `EthosAttestation::archiveAttestation()` that allows an address associated with an archived profile to archive an attestation connected to that profile.

## Vulnerability Detail

If a user wishes to leave the Ethos network and disable their profile, they are permitted to do so by archiving the profile and rendering it inactive. This means that the profile will not be able to act on the Ethos network. However, should a user choose to return, they are permitted to re-activate their profiles if they wish.
When `EthosAttestation::restoreAttestation()` is called, it checks whether the profile associated with the calling address is archived.

```solidity
  function restoreAttestation(bytes32 attestationHash) public whenNotPaused {
    ... ...
    (, bool isArchived) = IEthosProfile(ethosProfile).profileExistsAndArchivedForId(profileId);

    if (isArchived) {
      revert ProfileNotFound(profileId);
    }
    ... ...
  }
```

However, this is not done in `EthosAttestation::archiveAttestation()`.

```solidity
  function archiveAttestation(bytes32 attestationHash) external whenNotPaused {
    // ensure attestation exists
    Attestation storage attestation = attestationByHash[attestationHash];
    if (attestation.createdAt == 0) {
      revert AttestationNotFound(attestationHash);
    }
    // ensure attestation belongs to sender
    uint256 profileId = attestationByHash[attestationHash].profileId;
    bool senderBelongsToProfile = IEthosProfile(_getEthosProfile()).addressBelongsToProfile(
      msg.sender,
      profileId
    );

    if (!senderBelongsToProfile) {
      revert AddressNotInProfile(msg.sender, profileId);
    }

    attestationByHash[attestationHash].archived = true;

    emit AttestationArchived(
      profileId,
      attestation.service,
      attestation.account,
      attestation.attestationId
    );
  }
```

This means that any address associated with an archived profile will be able to archive an attestation connected to that profile. However, addresses associated with an archived profile should not be able to edit anything connected to that profile, except for restoring it.

### PoC

The following test should be added in `EthosAttestation.test.ts`:

```javascript
 
    it('should succeed if Profile is archived', async () => {
      const {
        OWNER,
        PROFILE_CREATOR_0,
        ethosProfile,
        ethosAttestation,
        SERVICE_X,
        ACCOUNT_NAME_BEN,
        ATTESTATION_EVIDENCE_0,
        EXPECTED_SIGNER,
      } = await loadFixture(deployFixture);

      // create profile 0
      await ethosProfile.connect(OWNER).inviteAddress(PROFILE_CREATOR_0.address);
      await ethosProfile.connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0).createProfile(1);
      const creator0profileId = String(
        await ethosProfile.profileIdByAddress(PROFILE_CREATOR_0.address),
      );

      let randValue = '123';

      let signature = await common.signatureForCreateAttestation(
        creator0profileId,
        randValue,
        ACCOUNT_NAME_BEN,
        SERVICE_X,
        ATTESTATION_EVIDENCE_0,
        EXPECTED_SIGNER,
      );

      await ethosAttestation
        .connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0)
        .createAttestation(
          creator0profileId,
          randValue,
          { account: ACCOUNT_NAME_BEN, service: SERVICE_X },
          ATTESTATION_EVIDENCE_0,
          signature,
        );

      // test PROFILE_CREATOR_0
      let attestationHash = await ethosAttestation.getServiceAndAccountHash(
        SERVICE_X,
        ACCOUNT_NAME_BEN,
      );

      await ethosProfile.connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0).archiveProfile();

      await ethosAttestation.connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0).archiveAttestation(attestationHash);

      const attestation = await ethosAttestation.attestationByHash(attestationHash);
  
      expect(attestation.archived).to.be.equal(true, 'Wrong archived');
    });
```

### Impact

Any address connected to the profile of the attestation can archive it, even if the profile itself is archived. This should not be possible.

### Tool Used

Manual Review

### Recommendation

Consider adding a check to ensure that the profile associated with the attestation is not archived, similar to the one in `EthosAttestation::restoreAttestation()`.
