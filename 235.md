# Lack of check if an address is compromised thereby allowing a malicious address to be invited

### Summary

The missing check in [inviteAddress](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L208) would allow a compromised address to be invited to create a profile.

For instance, if a profile is found malicious and flagged down, the address used in creating that profile should not be able to create another profile through an invite. If allowed, an attacker can continue to create havoc for the users

### Root Cause

in `ethosProfile.sol:208`, there is no check to ensure that an address being invited is a compromised addresss or malicious address.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L208

```soldity
function inviteAddress(
    address invitee
  ) public whenNotPaused onlyNonZeroAddress(invitee) checkIfCompromised(invitee) {
    (bool verified, bool archived, bool mock, uint256 profileId) = profileStatusByAddress(
      msg.sender
    );

    if (!verified || archived || mock) {
      revert InvalidSender();
    }

    (bool recipientExists, , bool recipientMock, ) = profileStatusByAddress(invitee);

    if (recipientExists && !recipientMock) {
      revert ProfileExists(profileId);
    }

    uint256 profile = profileIdByAddress[msg.sender];

    _profileShouldHaveInvites(profile);

    _isAddressAlreadyInvited(profile, invitee);

    sentInviteIndexByProfileIdAndAddress[profile][invitee] = profiles[profile]
      .inviteInfo
      .sent
      .length;
    profiles[profile].inviteInfo.sent.push(invitee);
    profiles[profile].inviteInfo.available--;
    sentAt[profile][invitee] = block.timestamp;
    emit UserInvited(profile,
```


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

1.THIS BREAKS THE STATEMENT IN ETHOSPROFILE TECHNICAL DOC; The address must not be compromised or already associated with another profile.
2. Opens the protocol to fraudulent activities

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a check in `inviteAddress function` that explicitly checks if the address being invited is compromised or is associated with a profile that has been marked as malicious
