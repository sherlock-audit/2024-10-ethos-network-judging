# M-1:Usage of `abi.encodePacked` can lead to hash collisions

### Summary

The hash is being created using `abi.encodePacked` at [`EthosAttestation::_keccakForCreateAttestation`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L521) and  [`EthosAttestation::getServiceAndAccountHash`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L428C12-L428C36) which contains dynamic type variables such as `string` and `bytes`. This can potentially lead to a hash collision due to the nature of `encodePacked`, which omits padding for more compact encoding. This increases the likelihood of hash collisions because different input values might result in the same packed output.

### Root Cause

In [`EthosAttestation.sol:435`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L435) and [`EthosAttestation.sol:528`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L528), the `abi.encodePacked` is packing dynamic types such as `string` and `bytes`.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A user needs to be verified in order to create attestation.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User calls the `createAttestation` with values which are susceptible to hash collisions.

### Impact

A genuine user will have his attestation creation denied even though the inputs being different from the ones of previous signature.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider using `abi.encode` to mitigate this issue.
