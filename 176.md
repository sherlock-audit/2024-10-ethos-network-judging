# Incorrect Check Implementation in `registerAddress()` Allows Duplicate and Compromised Address Registration


**Description**

In the [EthosProfile::registerAddress()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L364-L409) function, users can register new addresses to their profile, assigning the `profileId` to these addresses.

The issue arises when itâ€™s possible to register the same address multiple times for the same profile, since this [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L388-L390) is implemented incorrectly.

One of the core invariants of `EthosProfile` is, we cannot register compromised address to a profile.

lets say we have already registered `user1` to `profileId = 10` and then we re-register him again. now `profiles[10].addresses` array, will contain duplicate entries for `user1`.

If one instance of the `user1` address is deleted from the `profileId = 10` using the [EthosProfile::deleteAddressAtIndex()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L411-L438) function, `user1` will be marked as compromised.

but due to [incorrect implementation of check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L388-L390) in `registerAddress()` function, it will allow duplicate registration of same address to same profile happen, even if the address is compromised, because [profileIdByAddress[addressStr]](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L388) will be equal to [profileId](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L375) we are assigning and will not lead to `revert()`.

**Impact**

This vulnerability allows duplicate user registrations and bypasses a core invariant that prohibits re-registering a compromised address to a profile.

**Recommended mitigation**

To prevent duplicate address registration, the following refactoring of the [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L388-L390) in the `registerAddress()` function is recommended:

```diff
-    if (profileIdByAddress[addressStr] != profileId && isAddressCompromised[addressStr]) {
-      revert AddressCompromised(addressStr);
-    }
+    if (profileIdByAddress[addressStr] > 0) revert("addressStr is already registered");
+    if (isAddressCompromised[addressStr]) revert AddressCompromised(addressStr);
```

This modification ensures that an address already registered to a profile cannot be registered again, and prevents any compromised address from being added.
