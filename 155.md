# Inactive users can still archive Attestations !

### Summary

When archived, an user is supposed be inactive/deactivated with very minimal control on Ethos functionalities . 
From documentation `ethosattestation.md` : 
```solidity
EthosAttestation works closely with the EthosProfile contract to ensure that all attestations are properly linked to valid user profiles. This interaction includes:

Verifying that the profile creating or claiming an attestation exists and is active.
```
But, The `archiveAttestation` function in the `EthosAttestation` contract does not check whether the profile associated with the attestation is archived before allowing the attestation to be archived. This inconsistency can lead to situations where an attestation is archived while its associated profile is inactive or archived, potentially causing confusion and data integrity issues.

### Root Cause


The `archiveAttestation` function currently only checks if the attestation exists and if the sender belongs to the profile associated with the attestation. It does not verify the status of the profile (i.e., whether it is archived or active) before allowing the attestation to be archived.
The `archiveAttestation` function assumes that the profile associated with the attestation is active and valid. However, this assumption is not explicitly checked, leading to potential inconsistencies in the state of the contract.

### Impact

1. Data Integrity Issues: Archiving an attestation while its associated profile is archived can lead to confusion regarding the status of the attestation and its validity.
2. User Confusion: Users may not understand why an attestation is archived when the profile is inactive, leading to potential disputes or misunderstandings.
3. Potential Exploitation: If an attacker can manipulate the state of the profile, they may exploit this inconsistency to archive attestations inappropriately.

### Mitigation

Add this codeblock to `archiveAttestation` function :

```solidity 
    (, bool isArchived) = IEthosProfile(ethosProfile).profileExistsAndArchivedForId(profileId);

    if (isArchived) {
      revert ProfileNotFound(profileId);
    }
```
