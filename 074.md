# Attestation Reviews Not Transferred to New Ethos Profile Upon Reassignment

## Vulnerability Details
Users can submit **attestation reviews** through [EthosReview::addReview](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosReview.sol#L173-L219), which associates the review with the profile currently owning the attestation:
```solidity
function addReview(
    Score score, address subject, address paymentToken, string calldata comment, string calldata metadata, AttestationDetails calldata attestationDetails
) external payable whenNotPaused {
    // --SNIP
  if (subject != address(0)) {// --SNIP}
  else {
      // convert the service/account to a hash as an identifier
      attestationHash = _getEthosAttestation().getServiceAndAccountHash(
        attestationDetails.service,
        attestationDetails.account
      );
>>>      mockId = ethosProfile.profileIdByAttestation(attestationHash);
>>>      mockId = _addReview(mockId, subject, true, attestationHash, ethosProfile);
    }
}

function _addReview( uint256 mockId, address subject, bool isAttestation, bytes32 attestationHash, IEthosProfile ethosProfile )
  internal returns (uint256 subjectProfileId) {
    // if profileId does not exist for subject, create and record a "mock"
    if (mockId == 0) {
      // audit-finding Not persisting reviews when registering the profile
      subjectProfileId = ethosProfile.incrementProfileCount(
        isAttestation,
        subject,
        attestationHash
      );
    } else {
      subjectProfileId = mockId;
    }

>>>    reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId[subjectProfileId].push(reviewCount);
  }
```
If an attestation is transferred to another Ethos profile via `EthosAttestation::createAttestation`, the profile ownership of the attestation is updated:
```solidity
function _claimAttestation(uint256 profileId, bytes32 attestationHash, string calldata evidence) private returns (bool) {
  // --SNIP

  Attestation memory attestation = attestationByHash[attestationHash];
  if (attestation.profileId == profileId) {
      return false;
  }
  // --SNIP
  // Remove attestation from the previous profile
  _removeAttestationFromPreviousProfile(attestation.profileId, attestationHash);
  // Set new profileId for attestation
  attestationByHash[attestationHash].profileId = profileId;

  // Keep the profile contract up to date re: registered attestations
  IEthosProfile(ethosProfile).assignExistingProfileToAttestation(attestationHash, profileId);
}
```
The issue is that any reviews registered for the attestation under the previous profile are not transferred to the new profile that now owns the attestation. This is problematic because **attestation reviews should be registered under whatever Ethos profile owning them**
## Proof Of Concept
Consider the following scenario:
- Bob owns an X account linked to his Ethos profile (ID `3`).
- Three negative reviews are submitted for Bob’s X account, each associated with his profile.
- Alice, who has Ethos profile ID `5`, subsequently claims the X account by calling `EthosAttestation::createAttestation`. The account ownership is transferred to Alice’s profile (ID `5`), but the three negative reviews remain associated with Bob’s profile rather than moving to Alice’s profile.

## Impact
Reviews associated with an attestation do not persist when the attestation is moved to a new Ethos profile

## Mitigation
Consider migrating attestation reviews when they are registered under new Ethos profile.
