# The upgradeable contract lacks a gap

### Summary

The EthosAttestation, EthosDiscussion, EthosProfile, EthosReview, and EthosVote contracts are all UUPS upgradeable contracts; however, they have a complex inheritance relationship. Additionally, the contract storage does not adhere to the EIP1967 proxy storage slot standard. The lack of gaps in the storage between the underlying contracts may lead to storage conflicts during upgrades.

### Root Cause

                EthosDiscussion
                     /|\ 
                   /  |  \
          AccessControl  Common  UUPSUpgradeable
                |
        ------------------------------------------
        |                 |                    |

For example, the inheritance of EthosDiscussion
The underlying inherited contracts—AccessControl, Common, UUPSUpgradeable, SignatureControl, Pausable, and AccessControlEnumerable—lack gaps.
