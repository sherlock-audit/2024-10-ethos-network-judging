# Review will be lost when the target is affiliated with new Ethos profile.

### Summary

A review will be lost when the target is affiliated with new Ethos profile because the review is tied to the profile ID of the target instead of target itself.

### Root Cause

The [EthosReview::_addReview()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosReview.sol#L230) tie the added review to the profile ID of the target instead of the target itself.
- If the target is a subject address which is not affiliated with Ethos yet, a mock profile ID is created and the review will be tied to the mock ID. After that, when the subject address is affiliated with an Ethos profile in [EthosProfile::createProfile()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L158) or [EthosProfile::registerAddress()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L373), the reivew will remain tied to the mock ID.
- In the case that the target is a attestation, when the attestation is claimed by another profile in [EthosAttestation::_claimAttestation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L269), the review will remain tied to the old profile ID for the attestation.

After all, the review will not be tied to the new profile of the target and the new profile will lose the review.

### Attack Path

Scenario of subject address:
1. Subject address `addrA` is not affiliated with Ethos profile yet and a review `reviewA` is added for `addrA`. Thus `reviewA` will be tied to a mock prfile ID `pidMock`.
2. `addrA` is affiliated with Ethos profile ID `pidA`.
3. `reviewA` still remains tied to `pidMock` and has no relation with `pidA`.

Scenario of attestation:
1. Attestation `attestA` is created for profile ID `pidA` and a review `reviewA` is added for `attestA`. Thus `reviewA` will be tied to the `pidA`.
2. `attestA` is claimed by another profile ID `pidB`.
3. `reviewA` still remains tied to `pidA` and has no relation with `pidB`.


### Impact

Broken functionality, as reviews will be lost when their target is affiliated with new Ethos profile. This will influence the credibility score of the profile.


### PoC

### Mitigation

It is recommended to tie the reviews to the new profile ID when the subject address is affiliated with Ethos profile or the attestation is claimed by another profile.
