# pausableUpgradable from oppenzeppline must be used.

### Summary

In upgradeable contracts, storage layout is crucial because each upgrade must maintain the correct storage structure. Pausable.sol is designed for non-upgradeable contracts and does not use the same storage patterns as PausableUpgradeable.sol. Using Pausable.sol might result in storage clashes that could corrupt data, as Pausable.sol will not have the same initializer structure, making it incompatible with UUPS or other upgradeable proxy patterns

### Root Cause

In upgradeable smart contracts, maintaining a consistent storage layout is critical, as each contract upgrade relies on an unchanged storage structure to function correctly. The Pausable.sol contract was developed for non-upgradeable implementations, meaning it does not follow the same storage patterns as PausableUpgradeable.sol, which was specifically designed to support upgradeable architectures. If Pausable.sol is mistakenly used in an upgradeable context, there is a high risk of storage clashes. Such conflicts can lead to corrupted or misplaced data, as Pausable.sol lacks the initializer structure needed for compatibility with upgradeable proxies, including the UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard) and other proxy-based patterns. Therefore, using Pausable.sol in upgradeable contracts is unsafe and could result in significant issues.
