# It's possible to sybil attack `EthosProfile::createProfile`

### Summary

`EthosProfile` serves as a core to store identity info in the Ethos network. A profile represents the identity of an user. In Ethos protocol, which reputation and credibility holds a critical role, it's possible for an user to create many fake profiles, breaking the purpose of the protocol.

### Root Cause

The only way to get a profile is through [`EthosProfile::createProfile`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L158C1-L172C4):
```solidity
  function createProfile(uint256 inviterId) external whenNotPaused {
    (
      bool inviteSenderVerified,
      bool inviteSenderArchived,
      bool inviteSenderIsMock
    ) = profileStatusById(inviterId);
    if (!inviteSenderVerified || inviteSenderArchived || inviteSenderIsMock) {
      revert InvalidSender();
    }
    _inviterProfileAuthorizedSender(inviterId, msg.sender);

    uint256 newID = _createProfile(msg.sender);
    profiles[newID].inviteInfo.invitedBy = inviterId;
    profiles[inviterId].inviteInfo.acceptedIds.push(newID);
  }
```
Interestingly, there are no restrictions on who can create a profile as long as they have an available invite. This means, as long as one user holds an existing profile, it's possible for him to create multiple addresses, invite those addresses, rinse and repeat. However, if we look at `registerAddresses`, which serves the purpose of adding existing addresses of a profile owner to the same profile, requires a valid signature.

In other contracts in the protocol, such as votes, reviews, all takes review counts and vote counts accounted. The sybil attack in the context can be quite damaging as the purpose of the network relies on credibility. This means one user shall only have one valid profile associated with them.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

An user can create countless profiles by recursively invite other controlled addresses, this can break the credibility of the network, which is one of the core purpose of the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Requires a valid signature and evidence to create a profile.
