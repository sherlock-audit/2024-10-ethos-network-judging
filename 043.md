# Inadequate Authorization Checks for Review Archiving and Restoration

### Summary

In the `EthosReview::archiveReview` and `EthosReview::restoreReview` functions, only the `review.author` (i.e., the original address that created the review) is permitted to archive or restore a review. This implementation fails to consider that a profile can be associated with multiple addresses, which restricts other addresses linked to the author’s profile from performing archiving or restoration actions on the review. This results in an overly strict access control mechanism that limits valid profile addresses from managing reviews.

### Root Cause

The current implementation checks only `review.author == msg.sender` for archiving and restoring reviews. This excludes other addresses linked to the profile from archiving or restoring the review, as it does not consider the `authorProfileId` that associates multiple addresses with the profile.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The protocol associates multiple addresses with a single profile.
2. The user attempts to archive or restore a review using an address that is not the original review author but is linked to the same profile.

### External pre-conditions

1. The profile’s original author or other linked addresses must want to archive or restore their review.
2. The address attempting the action must be associated with the profile but not the direct author of the review.

### Attack Path

1. A user linked to the profile (but not the review author) attempts to archive or restore a review.
2. The `EthosReview::archiveReview` and `EthosReview::restoreReview` functions revert with `UnauthorizedArchiving`, restricting valid profile addresses from managing the review.


### Impact

Legitimate addresses associated with the author’s profile are unable to archive or restore reviews, potentially causing frustration and limiting the flexibility and usability of the review management system.

Refactor the authorization check to compare by `review.authorProfileId` instead of `review.author`.
```solidity
if (review.authorProfileId != profileId) {
 revert UnauthorizedArchiving(reviewId)
}
