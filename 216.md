# Uninitialized reviews default to a negative score, potentially harming user reputation

### Summary

The default value for the `Score` enum is 0, which corresponds to `Score.Negative`. This causes any uninitialized or unset score value in the reviews state variable to default to "Negative", potentially impacting the reputation of reviewed profiles as uninitialized reviews will appear as negative by default.

### Root Cause

In [EthosReview.sol: 31](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosReview.sol#L31), the `Score` enum is defined in the order `{Negative, Neutral, Positive}`, causing any uninitialized Score field to default to `Score.Negative`.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Review creation does not explicitly set the Score parameter.
2. The `Score` enum is defined such that the default value 0 corresponds to `Score.Negative`.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A user or contract creates a review without setting the score parameter explicitly.
2. Due to the lack of initialization, score defaults to `Score.Negative`.
3. The review is stored and publicly displayed with a "Negative" rating, unintentionally harming the reputation of the target profile or attestation.


### Impact

Users or profiles suffer reputational harm from unintended negative reviews. This creates a bias in review scoring, potentially misleading other users and damaging trust in the Ethos review system.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Change Enum Order: Reorder the Score enum to `{Neutral, Negative, Positive}`, so that the default value 0 represents `Score.Neutral`.
2. Add Validation: Require that the Score parameter is explicitly set during review creation and revert if it is left uninitialized or invalid.
