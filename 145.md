# Using non-upgradeable `Pausable` in UUPS contracts may cause initialization and storage alignment issues

### Summary

Using `Pausable` rather than `UpgradeablePausable` in an upgradeable contract system can lead to initialization and storage alignment issues. Since `Pausable` lacks an initializer and upgradeable-specific storage layout, it can cause unexpected behavior in proxy deployments. This results in potential uninitialized states, misaligned storage, and non-standard proxy behavior, impacting reliability during contract upgrades.

### Root Cause

The `AccessControl` contract inherits `Pausable` instead of `UpgradeablePausable`, which lacks the initializer and upgradeable-compatible storage layout necessary for UUPS proxy systems.



### Internal pre-conditions

1. The contract system must inherit from `AccessControl`, which uses `Pausable` instead of the upgradeable version.
2. A proxy-based contract initialization without an initializer or proper upgradeable-compatible state management.

### External pre-conditions

1. Deployment of the contract with a UUPS proxy architecture.
2. Potential future upgrades introducing new storage variables or dependencies requiring precise storage alignment.

### Attack Path

1. The contract inherits `Pausable`, which sets `_paused` to false by default but lacks an initializer function, causing initialization conflicts in proxy-based deployment.
2. During upgrades, the contract may experience storage misalignment due to the absence of upgradeable-specific storage layout management, leading to unpredictable behavior when attempting to pause or unpause.
3. Proxy compatibility may be compromised if the inherited pausing functionality relies on initial constructor setup or future reinitialization.

### Impact

The protocol may suffer from uninitialized states or misaligned storage, causing functional issues and impacting reliability during upgrades. If `_paused` is not correctly set, the pausing mechanism may fail, leaving the contract vulnerable to unintentional exposure or downtime.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Replace `Pausable` with `UpgradeablePausable` in all upgradeable contracts within the system. This change ensures that the `Pausable` mechanism aligns with proxy patterns, avoiding storage misalignment and supporting proper initialization across upgrades.
