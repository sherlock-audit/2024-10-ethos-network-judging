# `EthosReview::archiveReview` and `EthosReview::restoreReview`, breaks the Invariant that says - "Users can associate multiple addresses with a single profile ID, enabling participation from any wallet they own"

### Summary
"Users can associate multiple addresses with a single profile ID, enabling participation from any wallet they own". This invariant gets broken in contract `EthosReview.sol` in function `archiveReview` and `restoreReview`

### Root Cause

whenever a user gives a review at that time, mapping from review ID (`reviewCount`) to the `Review` struct is getting updated. mapping(uint256 => Review) public reviews; 

Inside function `addReview` ->

```solidity
// existing code

    reviews[reviewCount] = Review({
      archived: false,
      score: score,
 @>     authorProfileId: authorProfileId,
 @>     author: msg.sender,
      subject: subject,
      reviewId: reviewCount,
      // solhint-disable-next-line not-rely-on-time
      createdAt: block.timestamp,
      comment: comment,
      metadata: metadata,
      attestationDetails: attestationDetails
    });

// existing code
```
By observing carefully we can see that while updating this `Review` struct `authorProfileId: authorProfileId` and `author: msg.sender` is getting set, meaning the profiled and author address of the one who is giving that specific review is set.

Now we also have functions `archiveReview`, `restoreReview`, and `editReview` which are used to archive, restore and edit Review respectively for a specific review of the author's profile id. But here due to implementation of wrong revert check in function `archiveReview` and `restoreReview` the invariant that says - "Users can associate multiple addresses with a single profile ID, enabling participation from any wallet they own" is getting broken in certain edge case. 

Wrong check in function `archiveReview` -

```solidity 
        if (review.author != msg.sender) {
            revert UnauthorizedArchiving(reviewId);
        }
```
Wrong check in function `restoreReview` - 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/979e352d7bcdba3d0665f11c0320041ce28d1b89/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosReview.sol#L321

```solidity
        if (review.author != msg.sender) {
            revert UnauthorizedArchiving(reviewId);
        }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

Take all this flow into consideration - 
- A company has one `profileId` on Ethos Network that is managed by 2 user addresses (Founder & Co-Founder) 
- Co-Founder added a review from his address on behalf of the company's `profileId`. (from function `addReview`)
- After sometime a situation occurs where the Founder and Co-Founder  get separated from the Company due to some reason.
- Now in this case the `ProfileId` is still attached to both the addresses of the Founder and Co-Founder.
- Now here if the Founder wants to "archive a Review" that was added by the Co-Founder back in the days, then ISSUE will occur because -> Founder won't be able to "archive a Review" which was given by Co-Founder's address. Due to these check in function `archiveReview` - 

```solidity
        if (review.author != msg.sender) {
            revert UnauthorizedArchiving(reviewId);
        }
```

This will revert because `review.author` = Co-Founder's address, whereas the `msg.sender` in this example is Founder's address.

This breaks the invariant that is clearly mentioned in the `EthosProfile.sol` in comments "Key-Feature" section, that says - "Users can associate multiple addresses with a single profile ID, enabling participation from any wallet they own." 

**So here we can clearly see that the Founder's address is attached to the `ProfileId` But still due to the wrong check applied by the developer in the function `archiveReview` this INVARIANT is getting breaked. Instead, this invariant should be followed and whichever address is attached to the `profileid` should be able to pass the function `archiveReview`**

This same case will be vulnerable to the Function `restoreReview`.

Now here a conflict may arise that this is a Design choice made by developers. Well, I would like to state my points that why this is indeed a developer mistake and not a design choice - 

1) This clearly breaks the Invariant that I've mentioned above and breaking of any invariant is considered as H/M Issue.
2) This is clearly a developer mistake in function `archiveReview` and  `restoreReview`  because this same case scenario is not vulnerable in function `editReview`  because a correct check is implemented there, which take `review.authorProfileId` into consideration to check whether a profile Id of the `msg.sender` is associated with profile Id that was used give review. Therefore this function will pass correctly to edit a review that was given by Co-Founder's address and could be edited later Founder's address (just taken the above example to explain this more clearly).

_No response_

### Impact 

This breaks the invariant that says "Users can associate multiple addresses with a single profile ID, enabling participation from any wallet they own". We have seen in the above example how this invariant got broken.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Remove this checks in function `archiveReview` and `restoreReview` - 
```solidity
        if (review.author != msg.sender) {
            revert UnauthorizedArchiving(reviewId);
        }
```

And Instead add this similar check that was implemented in function `editReview` - 
```solidity
        uint256 authorProfileId = _getEthosProfile().verifiedProfileIdForAddress(msg.sender);

        if (review.authorProfileId != authorProfileId) {
            revert UnauthorizedEdit(reviewId);
        }
```
