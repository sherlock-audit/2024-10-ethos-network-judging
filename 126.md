# Address miscounting upon address restoration leads to an incoherent contract state

### Summary

In Ethos's protocol, a user can restore an already removed address by triggering the [`registerAddress`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L373-L409) function in the [`EthosProfile.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol) contract. However, the restored address is not removed from the user profile's [`removedAddresses`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/interfaces/IEthosProfile.sol#L13) array, leading to an incoherent contract state where an address is marked as both active and removed simultaneously.

### Root Cause

This issue occurs because the [`registerAddress`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L373-L409) function does not remove the restored address from the profile's [`removedAddresses`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/interfaces/IEthosProfile.sol#L13) array.

### Attack Path

Let's break it down step-by-step to illustrate the issue:

1. Bob, a user with a verified profile, has only one registered address.
2. Bob decides to register his second wallet by triggering the [`registerAddress`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L373-L409) function.
3. Bob then disassociates his second wallet by triggering the [`deleteAddressAtIndex`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L415-L438) function.
4. Bob later decides to restore his second wallet by triggering the [`registerAddress`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L373-L409) function again.
5. Bob's second wallet now appears in both [`addresses`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/interfaces/IEthosProfile.sol#L12) and [`removedAddresses`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/interfaces/IEthosProfile.sol#L13) arrays of his profile.

### Impact

This issue causes an incoherent contract state where a restored address is marked as both active and removed. Additionally, it results in an inaccurate count of addresses in a profile when the maximum threshold is checked by the [`checkMaxAddresses`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L732-L738) function, as a restored address is counted more than once. This miscounting leads to unfair limitations since a profile that performs address restoration will no longer be able to reach the maximum allowable addresses.

### PoC

Here's a complete Proof of Concept:

> **Instructions** to run the test:
> 1. Create a test file named `address.restoration.issue.test.ts` under the `test/profile/` folder.
> 2. Copy the PoC code snippet above into the file created in step 1.
> 3. Run the test by typing `npx hardhat test test/profile/address.restoration.issue.test.ts` in your terminal.

### Mitigation

Consider adding logic to the [`registerAddress`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L373-L409) function to remove a restored address from the profile's [`removedAddresses`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/interfaces/IEthosProfile.sol#L13) array.
