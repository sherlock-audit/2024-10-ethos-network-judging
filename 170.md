# Hash Collision Vulnerability in Attestation Service Verification

### Summary

Use of abi.encodePacked with multiple dynamic strings allows malicious users to potentially attach misleading attestations to their profile by manipulating service/account strings to generate the same hash while using a valid signature.

### Root Cause

In EthosAttestation.sol at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L192 , the signature verification hash is computed using abi.encodePacked:
```solidity
function _keccakForCreateAttestation(
    uint256 profileId, 
    uint256 randValue,
    string calldata account,
    string calldata service,
    string calldata evidence
) private pure returns (bytes32) {
    return keccak256(abi.encodePacked(profileId, randValue, account, service, evidence));
}
```
The issue arises because abi.encodePacked concatenates dynamic types (strings) without length prefixes:

If input is service="discord.co", account="m123", it produces: "discord.co" + "m123"
If input is service="discord.com", account="123", it produces: "discord.com" + "123"
Both result in same byte string: "discord.com123"

This allows crafting different service/account combinations that produce identical hashes, bypassing signature verification.

### Attack Path

- Attacker requests signature for attestation with seemingly innocent parameters (e.g., service "discord.co", account "m123")
- Instead, submits attestation claiming well-known identity (e.g., service "discord.com", account "123")
- Both inputs produce same hash due to abi.encodePacked concatenation
- Transaction succeeds as signature is valid for the colliding hash
- Result: Attacker creates misleading attestation appearing to verify ownership of a prominent account

### Impact

The attestation system's integrity is compromised as users can create misleading attestation of other service accounts.  They can craft variations which may appear legitimate, for example, both discord.co and discord.com may appear legitimate. This may even enable impersonation of prominent community members or services, undermining the trust in the attestation verification system.
