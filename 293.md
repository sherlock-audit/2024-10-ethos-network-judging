# Hash collision due to use of abi.encodePacked() in registerAddress function will cause anyone to use signature for different profileId then the one it is signed for

### Summary

In [registerAddress](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L373) function in `EthosProfile.sol` contract signature is getting verified using `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(addressStr, profileId, randValue));` in which profileId and randValue are of type uint256, it can be exploited as the signature which is signed for particular profileId can be use for another profileId in combination with randValue

### Root Cause

In [EthosProfile.sol:399](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L399) the choice of keeping profileId and randValue adjacent cause the issue and further it is [hashed](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L664) using abi.encodePacked() which causes exploiter to use different combination of input to use the same signature.

### Attack Path

- For example User with profileId `225` entered some value for addressStr and generated randValue for example `356` and Ethos signer signed that transaction for [registerAddress](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L373) but user used that value and didn't passed the transaction
- This signature id used further for inputs with profileId `22` and randValue `5356` and same addressStr param value and the transaction will still pass causing an exploit and unwanted behaviour bypassing Ethos signer and since there is no check if profileId entered belongs to msg.sender so it will pass

### Impact

- Anyone who has created account in Ethos can register address to profileId of anyone else or its own exploiter profile and can use the same signature which was generated for some other profile due to the attack path mentioned above.
- Any user can register address for profileId of other users if combination of profileId and randValue could satisfy it and can use the same signature as mentioned in attack path

### Mitigation

This issue can be mitigated in following ways
- Can change `_keccakForRegisterAddress(addressStr, profileId, randValue)` to `_keccakForRegisterAddress(profileId, addressStr, randValue)`
- Can use abi.encode() instead of abi.encodePacked in [this](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L659) function.
- Implement check if profileId entered belongs to msg.sender
