### Summary

Lack of access control in `registerAddress()` function - anyone can register an address for the any profile.

### Root Cause

[Link 1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L373)
There is no check in `registerAddress()` function that `msg.sender` adress exists in `profiles[profileId].addresses` mapping, meaning anyone can call this function and register any address to any user's profile.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Attacker calls `registerAddress()` function with his address as a `addressStr` parameter and victim's `profileId`.

### Impact

After registering himself on victims profile, he can call `deleteAddressAtIndex()` and delete owner's address, stealing profile from owner.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Always check that `msg.sender` is a registered address for `profileId`.
