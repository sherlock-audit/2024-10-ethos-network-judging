# User reviews can be edited by anyone in the profile breaking function invariant

### Summary

The `Ethos` protocol allows users to leave reviews of either users or attestations within the Ethos network. When a `Review` is created it is mapped to its `author` address and the corresponding `profileId`.

```solidity
/**
     * @dev Stores information about individual reviews.
     * @param archived Indicates whether the review is archived.
     * @param score The score of the review (positive, neutral, or negative).
     * @param author The address of the review author.
     * @param subject The address of the subject being reviewed. Should be the zero address if the review is for an attestation.
     * @param reviewId The unique ID of the review.
     * @param authorProfileId The Ethos profile ID of the author.
     * @param createdAt The timestamp of when the review was created.
     * @param comment The review comment provided by the author.
     * @param metadata Additional metadata associated with the review.
     * @param attestationDetails Details of the attestation if the review is based on an attestation.
     */
    struct Review {
        bool archived;
        Score score;
        address author;
        address subject;
        uint256 reviewId;
        uint256 authorProfileId;
        uint256 createdAt;
        string comment;
        string metadata;
        AttestationDetails attestationDetails;
    }
```

 Users can also modify their reviews and as per the `editReview(...)` function's [@notice](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosReview.sol#L252) only the original author should be able to do so. However, with the current implementation, any address under the given `profileId` can make edits to the review.
 
 

### Root Cause

Missing comparison between the `msg.sender` and the `review.author` addresses in the `EthosReivew::editReview(...)` function.

### Internal pre-conditions

### Attack Path

### Impact

Any address (including deleted(compromised) addresses) in a given `profileId` can make changes to a user's review, which breaks the intended behaviour as stated in the function's comments. If we see how the rest of the review modifying functions are created (`archiveReview(...)` and `restoreReview(...)`), we can confirm that only the original `author` address should be able to make changes to a given review.

```solidity
 function archiveReview(uint256 reviewId) external whenNotPaused {
__SNIP__
        if (review.author != msg.sender) { // correctly checks for author address
            revert UnauthorizedArchiving(reviewId);
        }
__SNIP__
    }
    
      function restoreReview(uint256 reviewId) external whenNotPaused {
__SNIP__
        if (review.author != msg.sender) { // correct author address check
            revert UnauthorizedArchiving(reviewId);
        }
__SNIPP
    }
```

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Add the proper `msg.sender` and `review.author` check in the `editReview(...)` function.
