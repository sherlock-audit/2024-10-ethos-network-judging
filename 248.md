# Potential Underflow via `_modifyVote` function  in `EthosVote` Contract

### Summary

A missing validation check for zero values in the `EthosVote` contract's `_modifyVote` function may cause an underflow when decrementing the `upvotesCount` or `downvotesCount`. This issue results in transaction reversion, disrupting users who attempt to modify their votes, and could lead to denial-of-service conditions for certain voting actions if not mitigated.

### Root Cause

In the [EthosVote: 188](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVote.sol#L188) contract, located in `_modifyVote()` function, underflows may occur because there are no checks to confirm that `upvotesCount` or `downvotesCount` are greater than zero before decrementing them. 
Solidity version 0.8.26, which is used in this contract, includes automatic underflow protection, meaning that the transaction will revert if a decrement operation is performed on zero. However, such a reversion prevents the function from successfully executing.`

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Vote Count: `upvotesCount` or `downvotesCount` for a specific target is 0.
2. User Action: The user calls `voteFor()` with the intention of modifying an existing vote.
3. Vote Status: The user's previous vote is active and not archived.
4. Vote Type: The new vote type (upvote or downvote) is opposite of the current vote.

### External pre-conditions

1. External Function Call: `voteFor()` is called by a user.
2.  This issue is self-contained within the contract.

### Attack Path

1. A user casts a vote, incrementing either `upvotesCount` or `downvotesCount`.
2. The user archives their vote, decrementing the count back to 0.
3. The user attempts to re-cast the vote (with the same isUpvote or the opposite type).
4. The function attempts to decrement the count of an already-zero variable, causing an underflow and transaction reversion.

### Impact

The affected users will experience failed transactions due to underflow reversion. This leads to:

1. Denial of Service: Users may not be able to modify or archive votes when the count is zero.
2. User Frustration: Users may incur additional gas costs due to failed transactions.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add Underflow Checks: In the `_modifyVote()` function, check that `upvotesCount` and `downvotesCount` are greater than zero before decrementing:

```solidity
if (vote.isUpvote) {
    require(vg.upvotesCount > 0, "Upvotes count cannot be less than zero");
    vg.upvotesCount--;
} else {
    require(vg.downvotesCount > 0, "Downvotes count cannot be less than zero");
    vg.downvotesCount--;
}

```
