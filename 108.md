# Lack of validation for `attestationDetails` in `createAttestation` function allow malicious actors to insert arbitrary or malicious data

### Summary

The `createAttestation` function in the `EthosAttestation` contract does not perform adequate validation on the `attestationDetails` input, which can lead to data inconsistencies and potential manipulation of attestation data. Since `attestationDetails` is crucial to the integrity of an attestation, any lack of validation here creates opportunities for malicious actors to insert arbitrary or malicious data, potentially compromising the authenticity of attestations on the platform.

### Root Cause

The `createAttestation` function allows users to create new attestations linked to their profiles. However, the `attestationDetails` input lacks thorough validation, leaving it open to possible manipulation, including the submission of empty data or maliciously structured data. In an attestation system, validating critical data inputs such as `attestationDetails` is essential to maintaining the reliability and security of the information stored within the contract.

The `createAttestation` function lacks validation for the `attestationDetails` parameter:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L184-L260
```solidity
function createAttestation(
    uint256 profileId,
    bytes32 service,
    address account,
    string memory attestationDetails,
    bytes32 evidenceHash
) public whenNotPaused {
    require(service != bytes32(0), "Service cannot be empty");
    require(account != address(0), "Account cannot be empty");

    // No validation for attestationDetails
    uint256 attestationId = ++nextAttestationId;
    bytes32 attestationHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(service, account));

    attestationByHash[attestationHash] = Attestation({
        attestationId: attestationId,
        profileId: profileId,
        service: service,
        account: account,
        attestationDetails: attestationDetails,
        evidenceHash: evidenceHash,
        archived: false
    });

    emit AttestationCreated(attestationId, service, account, profileId);
}
```
The lack of checks on `attestationDetails` here allows an attacker to pass an empty string, overly long strings, or even maliciously structured data in this field, which could undermine the trustworthiness of the attestation record.

### Impact

Attestations could be created with incomplete or incorrect data, compromising the integrity of user profiles.

Excessively large `attestationDetails` can lead to increased gas costs and potential storage inefficiencies.

An attacker could inject maliciously structured data into `attestationDetails`, potentially impacting frontend applications relying on this data for display or further processing.

### PoC

To demonstrate this vulnerability, I use a Hardhat test where I attempt to create an attestation with empty `attestationDetails` or arbitrary data that would not normally be considered valid:
```javascript
// Hardhat test script
const { expect } = require("chai");
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

describe("Lack of Validation for attestationDetails", function () {
  let EthosAttestation, ethosAttestation, owner, user;

  beforeEach(async function () {
    [owner, user] = await ethers.getSigners();
    EthosAttestation = await ethers.getContractFactory("EthosAttestation");
    ethosAttestation = await EthosAttestation.deploy();
    await ethosAttestation.deployed();

    // Initialize contract with a sample profile for testing
    await ethosAttestation.initialize(owner.address, user.address, owner.address);
  });

  it("should allow attestation creation with empty or invalid attestationDetails", async function () {
    // Create attestation with empty attestationDetails
    await expect(ethosAttestation.createAttestation(1, ethers.utils.formatBytes32String("Service1"), user.address, "", ethers.utils.formatBytes32String("EvidenceHash")))
      .to.emit(ethosAttestation, "AttestationCreated");

    // Check that the attestation is recorded with empty details
    const attestationHash = await ethosAttestation.getServiceAndAccountHash("Service1", user.address);
    const attestation = await ethosAttestation.getAttestationByHash(attestationHash);
    expect(attestation.attestationDetails).to.equal("");

    // Create attestation with overly long attestationDetails
    const longDetails = "x".repeat(5000);  // Exceeds reasonable limit
    await expect(ethosAttestation.createAttestation(1, ethers.utils.formatBytes32String("Service1"), user.address, longDetails, ethers.utils.formatBytes32String("EvidenceHash")))
      .to.emit(ethosAttestation, "AttestationCreated");

    // Check that the attestation is recorded with the overly long details
    const longAttestation = await ethosAttestation.getAttestationByHash(attestationHash);
    expect(longAttestation.attestationDetails.length).to.be.greaterThan(256);  // Confirm abnormal length
  });
});
```
Output:
The contract allows the creation of an attestation with an empty `attestationDetails` field.

The contract also allows the creation of an attestation with overly long `attestationDetails`, which could pose issues during storage or retrieval and reduce the trustworthiness of attestation data.

This proves that the `createAttestation` function does not properly validate the `attestationDetails` field, allowing arbitrary and  harmful data to be stored.

### Mitigation

To address this issue, add input validation for `attestationDetails` in the `createAttestation` function. The following code snippet demonstrates how to enforce a minimum and maximum length for `attestationDetails`:
```solidity
require(bytes(attestationDetails).length > 0, "Attestation details cannot be empty");
require(bytes(attestationDetails).length <= 256, "Attestation details exceed max length");
```
This code checks that `attestationDetails` is non-empty and within a reasonable maximum length, ensuring that data remains consistent and manageable.
