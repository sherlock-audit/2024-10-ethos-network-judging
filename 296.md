# Upgrades might cause storage collision

### Summary
When creating upgradable contracts that inherit from other contracts is important that there are storage gap in case storage variable are added to inherited contracts. If an inherited contract is a stateless contract (i.e. it doesn't have any storage) then it is acceptable to omit a storage gap, since these function similar to libraries and aren't intended to add any storage.
The contracts `EthosAttestation`, `EthosDiscussion`, `EthosProfile`, `EthosReview `and `EthosVote` inherit from the [AccessControl](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/utils/AccessControl.sol) and [SignatureControl](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/utils/SignatureControl.sol#L1), which are abstract stateful contract. The lack of _gap in these contract could lead to storage collisions if another state variables are introduced.

### Root Cause

Missing storage gap in `AccessControl` and `SignatureControl` contracts

### Impact

[AccessControl](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/utils/AccessControl.sol) and [SignatureControl](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/utils/SignatureControl.sol#L1) can pose a significant risk when updating a contract because they can shift the storage slots of all inherited contracts.

### PoC

_No response_


### Mitigation

Add storage gaps to all inherited contracts that contain storage variables.
