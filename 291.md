# _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray() is broken

### Summary

_deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray() removes wrong address from `removedAddress`
```solidity
  function _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray(
    uint256 index,
    address[] storage addresses,
    address[] storage removedAddresses
  ) private {
    address addr = addresses[addresses.length - 1];
    addresses[index] = addr;
    removedAddresses.push(addr);
    addresses.pop();
  }
```
