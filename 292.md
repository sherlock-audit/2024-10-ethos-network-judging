# Compromised accounts can use the profile freely

### Summary

The code comments in EthosProfile.sol state that accounts marked as compromised are supposed to be prohibited from certain actions, however no such limitations exist in the system.
```solidity
  // Keeps track of addresses that are compromised, preventing certain actions from being taken by these addresses.
  mapping(address => bool) public isAddressCompromised;
```

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path
