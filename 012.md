# A user claiming an address which was used as a `subject` in past for adding reviews by others will lead to loss of reviews due to a new `profileId` getting assigned

### Summary

A user registering an address using [`EthosProfile::registerAddress`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L373) for an address which was used as a `subject` in past for adding reviews using the [`EthosReview::addReview`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosReview.sol#L173) will lead to assignment of a new `profileId` due to insufficient checks, which in turn leads to loss of reviews and inconsistent data as state of `reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId` is not updated.

### Root Cause

The function [`EthosProfile::registerAddress`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L373)  lacks state updates for maintaining old reviews.
When a user adds review to a `subject` which is not claimed by the rightful user yet, it updates `reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId[subjectProfileId]` by creating a `subjectProfileId` generated from the [`EthosProfile::incrementProfileCount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L290)


```solidity
  function _addReview(
    uint256 mockId,
    address subject,
    bool isAttestation,
    bytes32 attestationHash,
    IEthosProfile ethosProfile
  ) internal returns (uint256 subjectProfileId) {
    // if profileId does not exist for subject, create and record a "mock"
    if (mockId == 0) {
      subjectProfileId = ethosProfile.incrementProfileCount(    <@ // creates a new subjectProfileId (`profileIdByAddress[subject] = profileId`)
        isAttestation,
        subject,
        attestationHash
      );
    } else {
      subjectProfileId = mockId;
    }

    reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId[subjectProfileId].push(reviewCount);   <@ // Reviews for a particular `subjectProfileId` is added
  }
```
But later, when the rightful owner of the `subject` address decides to register the address upon calling the [`EthosProfile::registerAddress`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L373) function, the `profileId` is now changed to a new one:
```solidity
  function registerAddress(
    address addressStr,
    uint256 profileId,
    uint256 randValue,
    bytes calldata signature
  ) external whenNotPaused onlyNonZeroAddress(addressStr) {
   // Rest of the code
    profiles[profileId].addresses.push(addressStr);
    profileIdByAddress[addressStr] = profileId;  // Newely assigned profileId
   // Rest of the code
}
```
But the `reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId` still holds the reviews on the old `subjectProfileId`.

### Internal pre-conditions

Considering user A and user B

1. User A is a genuine user with a verified profile
2. User B who is the owner of an address called `X`.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User A decides to add a review to a subject address `X` using the `addReview` function
2. User B, who is the actual owner of address `X` decides to claim the address by calling the `registerAddress`
3. This leads to change of the old supposed `subjectProfileId` to a new `profileId`, hence losing the track of the old reviews which were added by user A as protocol does not update the `reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId`.

### Impact

The protocol suffers from loss of reviews and inconsistent storage of `reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId` which contains reviews for lost subjectProfileIds.

### PoC

This test was added inside the [`EthosReview.test.ts`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/test/EthosReview.test.ts)

```javascript
  describe('addReview', () => {
    // Rest of the test cases
    it('should change the subject profileId to a new one', async () => {
      const { ethosReview, ethosProfile, REVIEW_CREATOR_0, REVIEW_SUBJECT_0, OWNER, REVIEW_CREATOR_1, EXPECTED_SIGNER } =
        await loadFixture(deployFixture);

      await inviteAndCreateProfile(ethosProfile, OWNER, REVIEW_CREATOR_0);
      await inviteAndCreateProfile(ethosProfile, OWNER, REVIEW_CREATOR_1);
      await ethosReview // adding a review which will generate a subjectProfileId
        .connect(REVIEW_CREATOR_0)
        .addReview(
          Score.Positive,
          REVIEW_SUBJECT_0.address,
          ethers.ZeroAddress,
          'Test comment',
          'Test metadata',
          { account: '', service: '' },
        );
      let getProfileId = await ethosProfile.profileIdByAddress(REVIEW_CREATOR_1.address);
        let signature = await common.signatureForRegisterAddress(
          REVIEW_SUBJECT_0.address,
          getProfileId.toString(),
          "1234",
          EXPECTED_SIGNER,
        );
  
        const review = await ethosReview.reviews(0);
        const reviewIds = await ethosReview.reviewIdsBySubjectAddress(REVIEW_SUBJECT_0.address);
        expect(review.reviewId).to.equal(reviewIds[0], 'Subject profile ID should be stored');
      
      await ethosProfile.connect(REVIEW_CREATOR_1).registerAddress( // Claiming the subject
        REVIEW_SUBJECT_0.address,
        getProfileId.toString(),
        "1234",
        signature
      )

      const reviewIds2 = await ethosReview.reviewIdsBySubjectAddress(REVIEW_SUBJECT_0.address); // As expected no more reviews for that particular address
      expect(reviewIds2.length == 0).to.be.true; // This leads to inconsistent storage in reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId.

    });
  });
```

This shows the loss of a mapping between the claimed `profileId` and the old `subjectProfileId`

### Mitigation

Consider updating the `reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId` when registering an address via `registerAddress`
