# `_deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray()` pushes wrong address to `removedAddresses` array

### Summary

EthosProfile.sol::_deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray() is supposed to push the deleted address to the `removedAddresses` array, but wrongly pushes last address of `addresses` array.
```solidity
  function _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray(
    uint256 index,
    address[] storage addresses,
    address[] storage removedAddresses
  ) private {
    address addr = addresses[addresses.length - 1];
    addresses[index] = addr;
>   removedAddresses.push(addr);
    addresses.pop();
  }
```

### Root Cause

EthosProfile.sol:591 mistakenly pushes last address of `addresses` array instead of the deleted one.

The deleted address doesn't get written to the `removedAddresses` array, instead an address that isn't deleted gets written there.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Push the deleted address to the `removedAddresses` array.
```solidity
  function _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray(
    uint256 index,
    address[] storage addresses,
    address[] storage removedAddresses
  ) private {
    address addr = addresses[addresses.length - 1];
    removedAddresses.push(addresses[index]);
    addresses[index] = addr;
    addresses.pop();
  }
```
