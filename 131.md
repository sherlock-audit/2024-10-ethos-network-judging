# When calling `registerAddress` to replace the subject pointing to `mockId` with the new `profileId`, `reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId` is not updated.

### Summary

Calling `registerAddress` to replace the subject pointing to `mockId` with the new `profileId` without updating `reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId` will prevent it from accurately tracking historical review, thus affecting reputation assessment.

### Root Cause

If a review is added to a subject that is not associated with any profile, a `mockProfile` will be created.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosReview.sol#L248
```solidity
  function _addReview(
    uint256 mockId,
    address subject,
    bool isAttestation,
    bytes32 attestationHash,
    IEthosProfile ethosProfile
  ) internal returns (uint256 subjectProfileId) {
    // if profileId does not exist for subject, create and record a "mock"
    if (mockId == 0) {
      subjectProfileId = ethosProfile.incrementProfileCount(
        isAttestation,
        subject,
        attestationHash
      );
    } else {
      subjectProfileId = mockId;
    }

->    reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId[subjectProfileId].push(reviewCount);
  }
```
However, the profileId corresponding to this subject may change. By calling `registerAddress`, a subject associated with a mockProfile can be pointed to a new profile. However, at this point, `reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId` is not updated, leading to previous comments still being associated with the mockProfile.
(The registerAddress function can be used to move a subject out of the mockProfile and point it to a new profile.)

```solidity
  function registerAddress(
    address addressStr,
    uint256 profileId,
    uint256 randValue,
    bytes calldata signature
  ) external whenNotPaused onlyNonZeroAddress(addressStr) {
    (bool verified, bool archived, bool mock) = profileStatusById(profileId);
    if (!verified) {
      revert ProfileNotFound(profileId);
    }
    if (archived || mock) {
      revert ProfileAccess(profileId, "Profile is archived");
    }
    // you may restore your own previously deleted address,
    // but you cannot register an address that has been deleted by another user
    if (profileIdByAddress[addressStr] != profileId && isAddressCompromised[addressStr]) {
      revert AddressCompromised(addressStr);
    }
    (bool addressAlreadyRegistered, , , uint256 registeredProfileId) = profileStatusByAddress(
      addressStr
    );
    if (addressAlreadyRegistered && registeredProfileId != profileId) {
      revert ProfileExistsForAddress(addressStr);
    }

    validateAndSaveSignature(
      _keccakForRegisterAddress(addressStr, profileId, randValue),
      signature
    );

    profiles[profileId].addresses.push(addressStr);
    profileIdByAddress[addressStr] = profileId;

    checkMaxAddresses(profileId);

    emit AddressClaim(profileId, addressStr, AddressClaimStatus.Claimed);
  }

```

### Internal pre-conditions

A review was left for a subject before it was associated with a profile, morkProfile is created.

### External pre-conditions

The subject owner calls `registerAddress` to change the subject's reference from the mockProfile to a new profile.

### Attack Path

1. When the subject is not associated with any profile, User1 adds `review1`, and a mockProfile (mockId = 2) is created. Currently,  
   `profileIdByAddress[subject] = 2`  
   `reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId[2] = review1`  
   
2. User2 calls the `registerAddress` function to associate the subject with a new profile (profileId = 3). Currently,  
   `profileIdByAddress[subject] = 3`  
   `reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId[2] = review1`  
   `reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId[3] = None`  

It can be seen that the subject is no longer associated with the mockProfile, but the review for the subject still exists in `reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId[2]`.

### Impact

`reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId` cannot track all comments related to this profile through the profileId, which could impact the evaluation process.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

In the `registerAddress` function, if the subject was originally associated with a mockProfile, update the related `reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId` for the subject.
