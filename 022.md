# Deleted address re-registration will cause double-counting errors

### Summary

A missing removal of re-registered addresses from `removedAddresses` will cause a double-counting error for users as `checkMaxAddresses` will count the same address twice, potentially causing a revert if the maximum address limit is exceeded.

### Root Cause

In `EthosProfile.sol`, there is a missing removal of re-registered addresses from the `removedAddresses` array, leading to double-counting in `checkMaxAddresses`.

Missed to remove from removedAddresses and sum can be greater than maxNumberOfAddresses.
It will revert.

### Attack Path

1. **User** calls `deleteAddressAtIndex()` on their profile, which sets `isAddressCompromised` to `true` for their address and moves it to the `removedAddresses` array.
2. **User** calls `registerAddress()` to re-register the previously compromised address, causing it to be added back to the `addresses` array. However, the address is not removed from `removedAddresses`.
3. When **User** attempts further actions that trigger `checkMaxAddresses`, the function counts the re-registered address in both `addresses` and `removedAddresses`.
4. **User** experiences a revert due to exceeding `maxNumberOfAddresses` as the re-registered address is double-counted, even though they are within the intended address limit.

### Impact

The **user** cannot add new addresses to their profile as `checkMaxAddresses` will incorrectly revert due to double-counting, even if they are within the allowed address limit.

### Mitigation

```solidity
function _removeFromRemovedAddresses(uint256 profileId, address addressStr) private {
    address[] storage removedAddresses = profiles[profileId].removedAddresses;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < removedAddresses.length; i++) {
        if (removedAddresses[i] == addressStr) {
            // Swap with the last element and remove
            removedAddresses[i] = removedAddresses[removedAddresses.length - 1];
            removedAddresses.pop();
            break;
        }
    }
}
```
```diff
function registerAddress(
    address addressStr,
    uint256 profileId,
    uint256 randValue,
    bytes calldata signature
) external whenNotPaused onlyNonZeroAddress(addressStr) {
    ...
    profiles[profileId].addresses.push(addressStr);
    profileIdByAddress[addressStr] = profileId;

+    // Reset the isAddressCompromised flag and remove from removedAddresses if re-registering
+    isAddressCompromised[addressStr] = false;
+    _removeFromRemovedAddresses(profileId, addressStr);

    checkMaxAddresses(profileId);

    emit AddressClaim(profileId, addressStr, AddressClaimStatus.Claimed);
}
```
