# Lack of `Compromised Address` Check Allows Unauthorized Replies in `EthosDiscussion` contract

### Summary

The missing verification for `compromised addresses` in the `addReply` function allows compromised accounts to add replies, compromising the integrity of the `EthosDiscussion` platform.

### Root Cause

In `EthosDiscussion.sol`, the function `verifiedProfileIdForAddress` from `EthosProfile` is used to verify the authorâ€™s profile. However, this function does not verify if the address is compromised, resulting in compromised accounts being able to interact without restriction.

### Internal pre-conditions

User's Profile must be verified in the EthosProfile contract.
Address status in EthosProfile should not indicate that the address is compromised.

### External pre-conditions

The compromised address is not flagged as compromised by EthosProfile.
EthosProfile does not have any other mechanism to prevent compromised accounts from interacting with EthosDiscussion.

### Attack Path

1. A malicious actor gains access to a compromised address.
2. The actor uses the compromised address to call addReply in EthosDiscussion.
3. The function proceeds without checking if the address is compromised, and the reply is added.

### Impact

`EthosDiscussion` users may encounter unauthorized comments or replies added by compromised accounts, impacting the integrity of the platform and potentially causing misinformation or other risks to users.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add checks to see if the address is compromised
