# Inadequate Restriction on Compromised Addresses Fails to Protect User Data Integrity

### Summary


The `EthosProfile` contract has a mechanism to mark addresses as compromised, but it does not effectively prevent these compromised addresses from performing actions on behalf of the profile. This design flaw allows an attacker with control over a compromised address to continue interacting with the Ethos network, potentially causing significant harm to the profile.

### Root Cause


The root cause of this issue is the lack of enforcement in the contract logic to restrict actions by compromised addresses. Although the contract maintains a mapping to track compromised addresses, it does not utilize this information to prevent these addresses from executing functions that require profile authorization.

### Internal pre-conditions


- The `EthosProfile` contract has a mapping `isAddressCompromised` that tracks whether an address is compromised.

- The contract allows multiple addresses to be associated with a single profile, enabling flexibility in participation.

### External pre-conditions


- An address associated with a profile has been compromised, meaning its private key is compromised , and an attacker has full control over it.
- The profile owner is aware of the compromise and marks the address as compromised using the provided functionality.

Private key theft is not very uncommon in web3 space . Here's 3 major private key theft exploit in just September & October   resulting in more than $15 million in total losses : [Tapioca](https://www.halborn.com/blog/post/explained-the-tapioca-dao-hack-october-2024) , [Truflation](https://www.halborn.com/blog/post/explained-the-truflation-hack-september-2024) , [DeltaPrime ](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/16/crypto-broker-deltaprime-drained-of-over-6m-amid-apparent-private-key-leak/) 

### Attack Path

1. An attacker gains control over a compromised address associated with a profile.
2. Despite the address being marked as compromised, the attacker uses it to perform actions on behalf of the profile, such as creating or modifying content, sending invites, casting votes , archiving attestations/profile , removing other valid addresses  ,interacting with other Ethos network contracts.
3. The attacker exploits this capability to harm the profile, potentially damaging its reputation . 

### Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is significant, as it allows attackers to continue using compromised addresses to perform unauthorized actions. This can lead to:
- Unauthorized transactions or interactions within the Ethos network.
- Damage to the profile's reputation and trustworthiness.
- Potential financial loss . 
- 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement logic in the contract to prevent compromised addresses from executing any functions that require profile authorization. This can be done by adding checks in relevant functions to ensure that the caller's address is not marked as compromised.

Note for judges : I'm aware that design improvements are not valid issue in sherlock if there's no fund loss . But The design inefficiency enables attackers to have full control over the profile &  perform unauthorized actions and fails to protect User Data Integrity, which is crucial for a social platform like Ethos .
