# defaultNumberOfInvites is zero

### Summary

`defaultNumberOfInvites` is the variable assigned to newly created profiles to set a limit on how many invites a profile can send.

The issue stems from that it is zero and profiles created will have **no possibility of inviting other addresses**.

### Root Cause

The root cause is that [defaultNumberOfInvites](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L54) value has no value set and **zero will be used as a default uint256 value**, thus making the users unable to invite other addresses to their profile, breaking core protocol functionality.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Alice creates a profile via `createProfile()`
2. Alice then decides to call `inviteUser()` and pass her second address to her profile
3. This will be impossible due to her profile having been assigned the zero value for available invites

### Impact

Users will be unable to invite other addresses to their own profile.
