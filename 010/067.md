# User can bypass review fee for free

### Summary

In `EthosReview.sol`, the following comment is present above the contract declaration - * - To create a review, the user must pay a protocol fee set by the admin team.

In the `initialize()`, we set the `reviewPrice` for ETH to 0 - [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosReview.sol#L134)

`_handlePayment()` is responsible for the payment in the creation of review and
the first thing the function do is [retrieve the price of payment token](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosReview.sol#L479)

### Root Cause

In `initialize()`, the price of ETH is set to zero, so any comments using ETH as `paymentToken` will be effectively for free.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Users can effectively leave reviews for free if they choose ETH as payment token in `addReview()`, which creates the possibility of malicious/spam reviews

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Do not add zero as a price to ETH in `initialize()`
