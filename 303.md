# `attestationById` does not get updated when attestations are claimed in `EthosAttestation`

### Summary

EthosAttestation records external attestations of web2 services and accounts for Ethos. These attestations play a crucial role in establishing a user's identity and reputation across various platforms integrated with the Ethos Network. These attestations when created can be claimed by other profiles. However, with the current configuration, after an attestation is created and assigned to [`attestationById`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosAttestation.sol#L247), later if it gets claimed, the `attestationById` will not be updated, leading to the storage variable containing stale data.

### Root Cause

In `EthosAttestation` after an attestation is created and is added to the `attestationById` global storage variable, it is never updated again after, when the attestation get claimed by other profiles.
