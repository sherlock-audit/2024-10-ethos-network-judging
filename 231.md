# Malicious Actor Can Permanently Ban Users Without Profiles by Registering and Immediately Unregistering Them, Preventing Future Interaction with Ethos Network

**Description**

In the [EthosProfile::registerAddress()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L364-L409) function, any user address can be passed to the [addressStr](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L374) parameter, allowing a malicious actor to register another user to their profile without consent.

After registration, the malicious actor can then use the [EthosProfile::deleteAddressAtIndex()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/db37b9dc2b792e245eb683d8a956bcb7ef2f1a27/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L411-L438) function to compromise the user by unregistering them. 

As a result, the compromised user is effectively banned and unable to interact with the Ethos Network indefinitely.

**Impact**

This vulnerability allows a malicious actor to permanently ban users who do not yet have a profile on the Ethos Network.

By forcibly registering and then immediately unregistering these users, the attacker can effectively prevent them from ever joining or participating in the network. 

**Recommended Mitigation**

The user registration mechanism should be revised as follows:

1. If `user1` with a valid profile wants to register `user2`, `user1` must send a *request* to `user2`, notifying them of the intent to register. If `user2` accepts, they will be registered to the profile. Otherwise, `user2` can reject the offer.

2. If `user2` wishes to be registered to a specific profile, such as `user1`’s profile, `user2` must send a *request* to `user1`’s `profileId`, notifying them of the intent to join. `user1` can then either accept the request and register `user2` or reject it.

This approach ensures that users with valid profiles cannot register other users without their consent, and users without profiles cannot register themselves to any profile without prior approval.
