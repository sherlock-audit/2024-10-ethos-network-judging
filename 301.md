# A compromised address does not lose any ability to perform actions on behalf of the profile

### Summary

The system has a mechanism for marking addresses as `compromised` to mark addresses that should not have access to actions on behalf of the profile. Unfortunately, this mechanism has no power, it does not limit anything.

### Root Cause

First-class citizen in the system is a profile. A profile can have multiple addresses attached that can act on its behalf. If any of the addresses should be deprived of the ability to run the profile, it is removed from it by marking it as `compromised`.

Unfortunately, this mechanism has no effect on access to functions and acting on behalf of the profile.

Authorization for most functions in the system is based on checking whether a given address belongs to the profile. The problem is that once an address is attached to a profile, it always remains so, and access restriction is based on marking it as `compromised` and placing it on the list of removed addresses. However, this data is not checked when checking access to individual functions in the system.

Example of checking whether an address belongs to a profile:
```solidity
    bool senderBelongsToProfile = IEthosProfile(ethosProfile).addressBelongsToProfile( //audit
      msg.sender,
      profileId
    );
```
Another example would be the lack of verification when sending an invitation:

```solidity
File: ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol
  211:     (bool verified, bool archived, bool mock, uint256 profileId) = profileStatusByAddress(
  212:       msg.sender
  213:     );
```

### Internal pre-conditions

- profile adds new address
- profile removes address marking it as `compromised`

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- the malicious address adds negative reviews to all large profiles in the ethos network, ruining their reputation
- in return, the profile receives negative reviews
- the profile loses its scoring due to the actions of the compromised address

### Impact

- An unauthorized address can act on behalf of the profile, write negative and positive reviews, archive and add attestations, and act to the detriment of the profile, e.g. by damaging its reputation.
- There is no way to block a compromised address.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

In functions that require authorization, in addition to checking whether the address belongs to the profile, you should also check whether it is not on a compromised list.
