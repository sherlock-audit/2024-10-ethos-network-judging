# User can dos another user from using a wallet to register an ethos profile

### Summary

A user can DOS another user from using a specific wallet forever by registering the victims wallet address to his profile and then unregistering(setting as compromised) the wallet address.

### Root Cause

in EthosProfile.sol ln ln 378
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L373

```solidity
  function registerAddress(
    address addressStr,
    uint256 profileId,
    uint256 randValue,
    bytes calldata signature
  ) external whenNotPaused onlyNonZeroAddress(addressStr) 
```
the function `registerAddress` allows a user to register another wallet address to his profile. Since there is no way to know if the wallet he is registering belongs to him or not, a user can abuse this to register a wallet which he does not own.

the function `validateAndSaveSignature` only validates that the hash of the parameters is signed by the ethos signer. It does not check if the wallet being registered has signed a message as shown below.

```solidity
    validateAndSaveSignature(
      _keccakForRegisterAddress(addressStr, profileId, randValue),
      signature
    );
```
```solidity
  function validateAndSaveSignature(
    bytes32 messageHash,
    bytes calldata signature
  ) internal onlyUnusedSignature(signature) {
    bool isValid = ISignatureVerifier(signatureVerifier).verifySignature(
      expectedSigner,
      messageHash,
      signature
    );

    if (!isValid) {
      revert InvalidSignature();
    }

    signatureUsed[signature] = true;
  }
```
```solidity
  function verifySignature(
    address expectedSigner,
    bytes32 messageHash,
    bytes memory signature
  ) external view returns (bool) {
    bytes32 ethSignedMessageHash = _getEthSignedMessageHash(messageHash);

    return SignatureChecker.isValidSignatureNow(expectedSigner, ethSignedMessageHash, signature);
  }
```
The ethos signer has no way of knowing that the address does not belong to a user since it does not request a signature from said wallet.

Now that the user has registered anothers wallet, he can call the following function with the victims wallet...

```solidity
function deleteAddressAtIndex(uint256 addressIndex)
```
the function will set the wallet to compromised and because in order to invite a wallet to create a profile the wallet must not be compromised, the specific wallet can never make an ethos profile. This can be observed below in the modifier `checkIfCompromised` in the function `inviteAddress`

```solidity
  function inviteAddress(
    address invitee
  ) public whenNotPaused onlyNonZeroAddress(invitee) checkIfCompromised(invitee)
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. the wallet must not yet have an ethos profile.

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. user registers victims wallet as his own
2. user sets the wallet as compromised
3. the wallet can never make an ethos profile

### Impact

Indefinite DOS for a user, Breaks core contract functionality.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Validate also a signature of the address being registered to a profile.
