# Hash collision due to use of abi.encodePacked()

### Summary

Use of abi.encodePacked in `EthosAttestation::createAttestation()`.

### Root Cause

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the use of `abi.encodePacked()` for hashing multiple string parameters within the `EthosAttestation::createAttestation()` function. This encoding method concatenates the `service` and `account` strings without any unique separation or padding, which can lead to ambiguous hash values. As a result, different combinations of strings can produce the same hash, making it possible for attackers to exploit hash collisions and generate misleading attestations using valid signatures associated with manipulated data.

### Attack Path

### Attack Path Using Example

1. **Obtain a Valid Signature**: The attacker starts by obtaining a valid signature generated for the following legitimate details:
   - `profileId = 135792468`
   - `randValue = 987654321`
   - `account = "CharlotteAndersonOfficial"`
   - `service = "LinkedIn"`
   - `evidence = "Verified employment at TechCorp Inc. via official company page on 10-10-2024"`

2. **Modify Input Parameters**: The attacker then manipulates the `account` and `service` strings to craft a new set of inputs that still produce the same hash using `abi.encodePacked()`:
   - `profileId = 135792468` (unchanged)
   - `randValue = 987654321` (unchanged)
   - `account = "Charlotte"`
   - `service = "AndersonOfficialLinkedInVerified employment "`
   - `evidence = "at TechCorp Inc. via official company page on 10-10-2024"`

3. **Call `createAttestation()` with Altered Data**: The attacker uses the previously obtained valid signature and the manipulated `account` and `service` values to call `EthosAttestation::createAttestation()`. Despite the changes to the `account` and `service` strings, the signature verification passes because the hash value remains the same due to hash collision.

4. **Create a Fraudulent Attestation**: The function executes successfully, creating a misleading attestation that misrepresents the user's association with the web2 service. This false attestation undermines the credibility of the Ethos Network.

5. **Impact on Real Owner**: Since the protocol allows "Users with valid Ethos Profiles to create attestations," and existing attestations can be claimed or transferred by other profiles, the real owner of the legitimate attestation may be unable to correct or recreate their original attestation with the correct parameters. The presence of the fraudulent attestation, created by the attacker using altered data, obstructs the real owner's ability to establish a valid association, effectively locking them out of the ability to claim or modify their rightful attestation.

By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can generate attestations with incorrect information, leading to significant consequences for the original owner and damaging the protocol's reputation as a reliable source for verifying user identities and associations.

### Impact

1. Creation of False
2. Obstruction for Genuine Users
