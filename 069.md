# User can be permanetly DoS'ed to register Profile in an edge case

### Summary

Users are encourged to register multiple addresses to their profile, and in case of compromise, they can delete any of those address. The same address can also be re-registered to the same profile later, is access is regained. However, due to a flaw in handling re-registration, an innocent user can be blocked from regaining access to their profile in an edge case.

### Root Cause

The core function on registering and deleting addresses from profile is written in `registerAddress` and `deleteAddressAtIndex`. In order to register an address, the user has to provide enough evidence to get signed off-chain by the protocol team in order to get a valid signature. In case of compromise, profile owner can delete this compromised address from the profile, to ensure this address will no longer misbehave and harm the reputation of this profile. 

The register function also allows a compromised address to register, in a scenaio which this may be done accidentally or the address access is regained. When an address is deleted from the profile, it will be popped from `Profile.addresses`, and pushed into `profile.removedAddresses`, as coded in [`_deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L584):
```solidity
  function _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray(
    uint256 index,
    address[] storage addresses,
    address[] storage removedAddresses
  ) private {
    address addr = addresses[addresses.length - 1];
    addresses[index] = addr;
    removedAddresses.push(addr);
    addresses.pop();
  }
```

However, we can notice, when a compromised address is re-added, it's not removed from `profile.removedAddresses`, but only pushed to `profile.addresses`:
```solidity
  function registerAddress(
    address addressStr,
    uint256 profileId,
    uint256 randValue,
    bytes calldata signature
  ) external whenNotPaused onlyNonZeroAddress(addressStr) {
    (bool verified, bool archived, bool mock) = profileStatusById(profileId);
    if (!verified) {
      revert ProfileNotFound(profileId);
    }
    if (archived || mock) {
      revert ProfileAccess(profileId, "Profile is archived");
    }
    // you may restore your own previously deleted address,
    // but you cannot register an address that has been deleted by another user
    if (profileIdByAddress[addressStr] != profileId && isAddressCompromised[addressStr]) {
      revert AddressCompromised(addressStr);
    }
    (bool addressAlreadyRegistered, , , uint256 registeredProfileId) = profileStatusByAddress(
      addressStr
    );
    if (addressAlreadyRegistered && registeredProfileId != profileId) {
      revert ProfileExistsForAddress(addressStr);
    }

    validateAndSaveSignature(
      _keccakForRegisterAddress(addressStr, profileId, randValue),
      signature
    );

    profiles[profileId].addresses.push(addressStr);
    profileIdByAddress[addressStr] = profileId;

    checkMaxAddresses(profileId);

    emit AddressClaim(profileId, addressStr, AddressClaimStatus.Claimed);
  }
```

Since the total available addresses has a limit, this will cause unexpected DoS in some edge cases.

### Internal pre-conditions

Suppose the total available addresses is 10, Alice owns 4 addresses, and she registered all 4 to her profile. However, one of her address is compromised.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

The attacker first signs a transaction using compromised address 0xC to delete all other non-compromised addresses in the profile, now the length of `profile.removedAddresses` is 3. Alice would then contact with the protocol team, get valid signatures again, and register to her profile, and tries to delete this compromised address. The attacker is a step ahead, deletes all registered addresses again, if this happens multiple times, the length of `profile.removedAddresses` would reach value such as 7 or 8. When Alice wants to register again, she would be rejected by a reverted transaction, this is because the total available address amount is reached. This way, Alice would be permanently DoS'ed to register to a profile.

### Impact

Users would be permanently DoS'ed in an edge case introduced above, due to when registering a compromised address, `profile.removedAddresses` is not updated.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

If a compromised address is re-added, remove the entry from `profile.removedAddresses`.
