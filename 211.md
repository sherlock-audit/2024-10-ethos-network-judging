# Arbitrary code execution

### Summary

Any verified profile can execute arbitrary code in behalf of `EthosDiscussion` 
as `msg.sender` through [EthosDiscussion::addReply()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosDiscussion.sol#L122)


### Root Cause

Whenever a verified profile tries to add a reply through [EthosDiscussion::addReply()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosDiscussion.sol#L105)
and `targetContract` is not `EthosDiscussion` address. Then [_checkIfTargetExistsAndAllowed(targetContract, targetId)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosDiscussion.sol#L122)
is executed.
```solidity
  /**
   * @dev Checks if the target exists and is allowed.
   * @param targetContract Target contract address.
   * @param targetId Target id.
   */
  function _checkIfTargetExistsAndAllowed(address targetContract, uint256 targetId) private view {
    (bool exists, ) = ITargetStatus(targetContract).targetExistsAndAllowedForId(targetId);

    if (!exists) {
      revert TargetNotFound(targetContract, targetId);
    }
  }
```
The problem here is that `targetContract` is not validated and can be any contract.
Therefore, if a bad actor deploys a contract that implements `ITargetStatus`, the 
code will be executed with `EthosDiscussion` as `msg.sender`.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

I have not found any immediate impact by this action in this contract, as `EthosDiscussion`
doesn't execute any permissioned functions in the scoped contracts. I'm 
reporting this issue as medium as the contract is upgradable and this can cause issues 
in future updates. 


### PoC

### Mitigation

Consider using `contractAddressManager.checkIsEthosContract(target)` or similar 
to validate the contracts.
