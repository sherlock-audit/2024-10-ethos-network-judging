# Reviews created for a subject(attestation or address) without a profile will be lost when the subject is created or registered with a verified profile.

### Summary

When an attestation is not linked to any profile, a mock profile is created by setting the `profileIdByAttestation` which is used by the `reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId` to track the reviews for the profileId. When the attestation is created by a verified profile the `profileIdByAttestation` for the attestation is updated. Since the `reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId` is not updated to the new profile Id of the attestation, the reviews previously linked to the attestation will be lost.
This is also true for when reviews are left for an address without a profile, the reviews will be lost when the address is registered by a profile as the `profileByAddress` mapping will be updated.

### Root Cause

Not updating the `reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId` for an attestation to the new profileId when the `profileIdByAttestation` is updated, and also not updating the `reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId` mapping for an address to the new profileId when the  `profileByAddress` mapping is updated.

### Internal pre-conditions

- The review creator needs to have a profile
- Reviews need to be added with the subject as an attestation or address that isn't linked to any profile
- The owner of the attestation/address needs to create a profile
- The owner of the attestation adds/creates the attestation or registers the address to link it to their profile 

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User A calls `EthosReview::addReview` and pays a fee to leave a review on User B's attestation, since User B has not linked the attestation to their profile(or doesn't have a profile), a mock is created with profileId X  by setting the `profileIdByAttestation` mapping of the attestation to X, and this profileId is used to track the reviews by adding the reviewId to `reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId` which holds the array of reviewID's by a profile(X).
2. User B creates a profile with profileId (Y) and calls `EthosAttestation::createAttestation` with their attestation details which updates the `profileIdByAttestation` of the attestation to Y. 
3. Since the attestations new profileId (Y) is not linked to the `reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId` the reviews left to the mock will be lost as there is no link between the attestation and the mock (X) previously created

### Impact

The reviews will not be linked to the attestation or address, hence they will be lost which is more severe as users pay to leave reviews and reviews have a huge impact on reputation.

### PoC

```javascript
it('POC -- reviews not linked to attestation', async () => {
      const {
        ethosReview,
        ethosProfile,
        ethosAttestation,
        REVIEW_CREATOR_0,
        OWNER,
        OTHER_0,
        ACCOUNT_NAME_BEN,
        SERVICE_X,
        ATTESTATION_EVIDENCE_0,
        EXPECTED_SIGNER,
      } = await loadFixture(deployFixture);
      await inviteAndCreateProfile(ethosProfile, OWNER, REVIEW_CREATOR_0);
      
      await ethosReview
      .connect(REVIEW_CREATOR_0)
      .addReview(
        Score.Positive,
        ethers.ZeroAddress,
        ethers.ZeroAddress,
        'Test comment',
        'Test metadata',
        { account: ACCOUNT_NAME_BEN, service: SERVICE_X },
      );

      const review = await ethosReview.reviews(0);
      const attestationHash = await ethosAttestation.getServiceAndAccountHash(
        review.attestationDetails.service,
        review.attestationDetails.account,

      );
      const reviewsBySubjectHash = //array of reviewIds
        await ethosReview.reviewIdsBySubjectAttestationHash(attestationHash);
     const profileIdOfAttestation = await ethosProfile.profileIdByAttestation(attestationHash);
     let {verified, archived, mock} = await ethosProfile.profileStatusById( profileIdOfAttestation);
     expect(mock).to.equal(true);
     expect(verified).to.be.equal(false);
     expect(archived).to.be.equal(false);
     expect(reviewsBySubjectHash.length).to.be.equal(1, "Wrong length of reviews");
     expect(review.reviewId).to.equal(reviewsBySubjectHash[0]);

      const other0profileId = await inviteAndCreateProfile(ethosProfile, OWNER, OTHER_0);

      const randValue = '123';
      const signature = await common.signatureForCreateAttestation(
        other0profileId,
        randValue,
        ACCOUNT_NAME_BEN,
        SERVICE_X,
        ATTESTATION_EVIDENCE_0,
        EXPECTED_SIGNER,
      );
      await ethosAttestation
        .connect(OTHER_0)
        .createAttestation(
          other0profileId,
          randValue,
          { account: ACCOUNT_NAME_BEN, service: SERVICE_X },
          ATTESTATION_EVIDENCE_0,
          signature,
        );
        //The reviews are not linked to the created profile.
        const reviewsBySubjectHash1 = //array of reviewIds
        await ethosReview.reviewIdsBySubjectAttestationHash(attestationHash);
     const profileIdOfAttestation1 = await ethosProfile.profileIdByAttestation(attestationHash);
      [verified, archived, mock] = await ethosProfile.profileStatusById( profileIdOfAttestation1);
     expect(mock).to.equal(false);
     expect(verified).to.be.equal(true);
     expect(archived).to.be.equal(false);
     expect(reviewsBySubjectHash1.length).to.be.equal(0, "Wrong length of reviews");
        
    });
```

### Mitigation

Update the `reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId`mapping for an attestation when the `profileIdByAttestation` mapping is updated and for an address update the `reviewIdsBySubjectProfileId` mapping when the `profileIdByAddress` mapping is updated.
