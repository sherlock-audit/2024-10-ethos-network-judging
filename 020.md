# checkIsAddressCompromised will always revert on restored addresses (Including inviteAddress)

### Summary

A missing reset of the `isAddressCompromised` flag for restored addresses will cause an unintended revert for legitimate users as `checkIsAddressCompromised` will always return compromised status, blocking user access.
`inviteAddress` function also reverted because of modifier `checkIfCompromised`.

### Root Cause

In `EthosProfile.sol`, the `registerAddress` function does not reset the `isAddressCompromised` flag for restored addresses, causing `checkIsAddressCompromised` to always revert when invoked on a previously compromised address.

In `deleteAddressAtIndex`,

isAddressCompromised[addressStr] = true;

This does not reset the `isAddressCompromised` flag for restored addresses.

Always reverts.

Reverts.

If invitee is already registered, `inviteAddress` is reverted but revert reason is not right because it is already restored.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. **User** calls `deleteAddressAtIndex()` on their profile to set the address as compromised, which marks `isAddressCompromised` as `true` for that address.
2. **User** attempts to restore the address by calling `registerAddress()`, which should allow re-registration but fails to reset `isAddressCompromised` to `false`.
3. Any subsequent attempt by the **User** to perform actions requiring `checkIsAddressCompromised()` or `inviteAddress()` will fail, as these functions will detect the address as compromised and revert due to the unchanged `true` status of `isAddressCompromised`.

### Impact

The **user** successfully re-registers a previously compromised address, but any subsequent calls to `checkIsAddressCompromised` and `inviteAddress` will always revert, as these functions incorrectly mark the address as still compromised. This prevents the **user** from performing actions dependent on these functions, even though the address has been restored.

### Mitigation

```diff
function registerAddress(
    address addressStr,
    uint256 profileId,
    uint256 randValue,
    bytes calldata signature
) external whenNotPaused onlyNonZeroAddress(addressStr) {
 ...
+    // Reset the isAddressCompromised flag to false upon re-registration
+   isAddressCompromised[addressStr] = false;
 ...
}
```
