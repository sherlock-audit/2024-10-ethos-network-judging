# Deleted address will still have full control over the profile.

### Summary

After calling the [deleteAddressAtIndex()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L415), the address is still associated with the profile from which it was deleted, permitting full access to the profile.

### Root Cause

In  `deleteAddressAtIndex()`, the address is removed from the profile's list of addresses, but the mapping `profileIdByAddress` is left unchanged, which will enable the compromised address to be associated with the profile, hence authenticated as it.
The mapping is used by `addressBelongsToProfile()` and `profileStatusByAddress()`. The latter one is used also in `verifiedProfileIdForAddress()` which is used across all other contracts, to verify that the `msg.sender` is an address from verified profile. 

```solidity
  function deleteAddressAtIndex(uint256 addressIndex) external whenNotPaused {
    uint256 profileId = profileIdByAddress[msg.sender];
    (bool verified, bool archived, bool mock) = profileStatusById(profileId);
    if (!verified) {
      revert ProfileNotFoundForAddress(msg.sender);
    }
    if (archived || mock) {
      revert ProfileAccess(profileId, "Profile is archived");
    }

    address[] storage addresses = profiles[profileId].addresses;
    address[] storage removedAddresses = profiles[profileId].removedAddresses;
    if (addresses.length <= addressIndex) {
      revert InvalidIndex();
    }

    address addressStr = addresses[addressIndex];
    isAddressCompromised[addressStr] = true;
    _addressShouldDifferFromSender(addressStr);

    _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray(addressIndex, addresses, removedAddresses);

    emit AddressClaim(profileId, addressStr, AddressClaimStatus.Unclaimed);
  }
```

```solidity
  function addressBelongsToProfile(
    address addressStr,
    uint256 profileId
  ) external view returns (bool) {
    if (profileIdByAddress[addressStr] == 0) {
      revert ProfileNotFoundForAddress(addressStr);
    }
 @>   return profileIdByAddress[addressStr] == profileId;
  }
```

```solidity
function profileStatusByAddress(
    address addressStr
  ) public view returns (bool verified, bool archived, bool mock, uint256 profileId) {
 @>   profileId = profileIdByAddress[addressStr];
    (verified, archived, mock) = profileStatusById(profileId);
  }
```


```solidity
  function verifiedProfileIdForAddress(address _address) external view returns (uint256) {
@>    (bool verified, bool archived, bool mock, uint256 profileId) = profileStatusByAddress(_address);
    if (!verified || archived || mock) {
      revert ProfileNotFoundForAddress(_address);
    }
    return profileId;
  }
```


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. A registered address to be compromised

### Attack Path

1. Registered address is compromised.
2. The user calls `deleteAddressAtIndex()` to remove the address from the profile.
3. The compromised address can execute operations on behalf of the profile.

### Impact

The  user will not be able to remove compromised address, and they can be impersonated by the address.

### Mitigation

```diff
 /**
   * @dev Deletes an address at index.
   * @param addressIndex Index of address to be archived.
   */
  function deleteAddressAtIndex(uint256 addressIndex) external whenNotPaused {
    uint256 profileId = profileIdByAddress[msg.sender];
    (bool verified, bool archived, bool mock) = profileStatusById(profileId);
    if (!verified) {
      revert ProfileNotFoundForAddress(msg.sender);
    }
    if (archived || mock) {
      revert ProfileAccess(profileId, "Profile is archived");
    }

    address[] storage addresses = profiles[profileId].addresses;
    address[] storage removedAddresses = profiles[profileId].removedAddresses;
    if (addresses.length <= addressIndex) {
      revert InvalidIndex();
    }

    address addressStr = addresses[addressIndex];
    isAddressCompromised[addressStr] = true;
    _addressShouldDifferFromSender(addressStr);

    _deleteAddressAtIndexFromArray(addressIndex, addresses, removedAddresses);
+   profileIdByAddress[addressStr]=0;

    emit AddressClaim(profileId, addressStr, AddressClaimStatus.Unclaimed);
  }
```

This fix will require update of the logic in `registerAddress()` so that users can restore preciously deleted addresses.
