# `addressBelongsToProfile` function does not check whether the address has been removed.

### Summary

`addressBelongsToProfile` does not check whether the address has already been removed from the profile, allowing removed addresses to retain certain permissions to modify the profile's authorization status.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L532C4-L540C4
```solidity
  function addressBelongsToProfile(
    address addressStr,
    uint256 profileId
  ) external view returns (bool) {
    if (profileIdByAddress[addressStr] == 0) {
      revert ProfileNotFoundForAddress(addressStr);
    }
    return profileIdByAddress[addressStr] == profileId;
  }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

There is an address of a profile that has been removed.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

The removed address still retains certain permissions to operate on the profileâ€™s authorization status.

### Impact

The following functions are impacted:

1. **_claimAttestation** - Removed addresses can still transfer the authorization to the profile.
2. **archiveAttestation** - Removed addresses can still close the authorization.
3. **restoreAttestation** - Removed addresses can still reopen closed authorizations.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
      function addressBelongsToProfile(
        address addressStr,
        uint256 profileId
-     ) external view returns (bool) {
+     ) external checkIfCompromised(addressStr) view returns (bool) {
        if (profileIdByAddress[addressStr] == 0) {
          revert ProfileNotFoundForAddress(addressStr);
        }
        return profileIdByAddress[addressStr] == profileId;
      }
```
