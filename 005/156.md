# `AccessControl` Contract Updater will Potentially Disrupt `EthosProfile` `EthosAttestation` `EthosDiscussion` `EthosReview` `EthosVote` `EthosVouch` `ReputationMarket` Upgradable Contracts

### Summary

## Vulnerability: 
`AccessControl` contract updates can potentially disrupt multiple upgradable contracts due to incompatible storage layout and lack of upgradability consideration.

If `AccessControl` adds a new state variable in a future version, without properly managing the storage layout, it could overwrite or collide with existing state variables in the affected contracts, leading to unintended behavior or data corruption.
## Affected Contracts (7):
- EthosProfile
- EthosAttestation
- EthosDiscussion
- EthosReview
- EthosVote
- EthosVouch
- ReputationMarket

### Root Cause

The upgradable nature of affected contracts, combined with the potential for future state variable additions to `AccessControl`, introduces a risk of storage collisions. This could lead to unintended behavior or data corruption if not properly mitigated.

### Internal pre-conditions

1 - `AccessControl` storage variable(s) added.
2 - Protocol Upgrade

### External pre-conditions

1 - A critical vulnerability found in the openzepplin `AccessControl` contract.
2 - Updating the contract or the parent contracts for more security.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- The vulnerability's impact is significant due to the potential for system-wide disruptions, data integrity issues, and contract functionality malbehaviors.
- However, the impact is not maximal because the vulnerability requires a specific action (updating the AccessControl contract) to trigger the disruption, and some contracts might have mitigating factors in place.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Storage gaps could be a solution but to ensure seamless upgradability and maintain the security posture of the target contracts, it's recommended to replace `AccessControl` with `AccessControlUpgradable`. This contract is specifically designed for upgradable contracts, providing a more compatible and future-proof access control mechanism.
