# EthosProfile.sol :: registerAddress() does not remove restored addresses from the removedAddresses array, which restricts users from registering the maximum number of permitted addresses.

### Summary

**`registerAddress()`** adds an address to a specific profile. However, an issue occurs when an address is removed and subsequently re-added, as it remains in the **`removedAddresses`** array. This oversight prevents the user from registering the maximum allowed number of addresses for their profile.

### Root Cause

[registerAddress()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/979e352d7bcdba3d0665f11c0320041ce28d1b89/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L373-L409) is implemeted as follows.
```Solidity
function registerAddress(
    address addressStr,
    uint256 profileId,
    uint256 randValue,
    bytes calldata signature
  ) external whenNotPaused onlyNonZeroAddress(addressStr) {
    (bool verified, bool archived, bool mock) = profileStatusById(profileId);
    if (!verified) {
      revert ProfileNotFound(profileId);
    }
    if (archived || mock) {
      revert ProfileAccess(profileId, "Profile is archived");
    }
    // you may restore your own previously deleted address,
    // but you cannot register an address that has been deleted by another user
@>  if (profileIdByAddress[addressStr] != profileId && isAddressCompromised[addressStr]) {
      revert AddressCompromised(addressStr);
    }
    (bool addressAlreadyRegistered, , , uint256 registeredProfileId) = profileStatusByAddress(
      addressStr
    );
    //if exists and is registred to other profile reverts
    if (addressAlreadyRegistered && registeredProfileId != profileId) {
      revert ProfileExistsForAddress(addressStr);
    }

    validateAndSaveSignature(
      _keccakForRegisterAddress(addressStr, profileId, randValue),
      signature
    );

    profiles[profileId].addresses.push(addressStr);
    profileIdByAddress[addressStr] = profileId;

    checkMaxAddresses(profileId);

    emit AddressClaim(profileId, addressStr, AddressClaimStatus.Claimed);
  }
```
As illustrated, a user can re-add an address that was previously deleted. The issue arises because, when an address is removed, it is added to the [removedAddresses](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-ethos-network/blob/979e352d7bcdba3d0665f11c0320041ce28d1b89/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L591) array (this line contains an error that has been reported in another report). This array is then used to calculate the maximum number of addresses allowed in **`checkMaxAddresses`**.
```Solidity
function checkMaxAddresses(uint256 profileId) internal view {
    uint256 sum = profiles[profileId].addresses.length;
    sum += profiles[profileId].removedAddresses.length;
    if (sum > maxNumberOfAddresses) {
      revert MaxAddressesReached(profileId);
    }
  }
```
The issue is that when an address is restored, it is not removed from the **`removedAddresses`** array. This oversight prevents users from adding the maximum number of addresses allowed, as the same address appears in both the **`addresses`** and **`removedAddresses`** arrays. 

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

The issue lies inherently within the code itself.

### Impact

The restored addresses are not removed from the **`removedAddresses`** array, which prevents the user from registering the maximum number of allowed addresses.

### PoC

To illustrate the problem more clearly, letâ€™s consider the following example with **`maxNumberOfAddresses = 2`**. Assume that Alice's address has not been added.

1. Alice calls **`registerAddress()`** to add `address(1)` and `address(2)` to her profile.
2. The length of the **`addresses`** array is updated to 2.
3. Alice calls **`deleteAddressAtIndex()`** to remove **`address(2)`**.
4. The length of the **`addresses`** array is updated to 1, while the **`removedAddresses`** array is updated to 1.
5. Alice calls **`registerAddress()`** to restore **`address(2)`**.
6. The length of the **`addresses`** array is updated to 2, but the **`removedAddresses`** array remains at 1 since the deleted address was not removed from it.
7. The transaction reverts because the total length of **`addresses + removedAddresses = 2 + 1 = 3`**, which exceeds **`maxNumberOfAddresses = 2`**.
8. Alice cannot restore the previously deleted address because the system incorrectly counts her as having 3 addresses, while she actually only has 2.

To illustrate the problem, copy the following POC into **`EthosProfile.test.ts`**.
```js
it('registerAddress not works properly', async () => {
      const { ethosProfile, PROFILE_CREATOR_0, EXPECTED_SIGNER, OTHER_0, OTHER_1, OWNER, ADMIN } =
        await loadFixture(deployFixture);

      const profileId = String(2);
      let rand = '123';
      let signature = await common.signatureForRegisterAddress(
        OTHER_0.address,
        profileId,
        rand,
        EXPECTED_SIGNER,
      );

      //maxNumberOfAddresses = 3
      await ethosProfile.connect(ADMIN).setMaxAddresses(3);

      await ethosProfile.connect(OWNER).inviteAddress(PROFILE_CREATOR_0.address);
      await ethosProfile.connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0).createProfile(1);

      //register address(1)
      await ethosProfile
        .connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0)
        .registerAddress(OTHER_0.address, profileId, rand, signature);

      rand = '456';
      signature = await common.signatureForRegisterAddress(
        OTHER_1.address,
        profileId,
        rand,
        EXPECTED_SIGNER,
      );

      //register address(2)
      await ethosProfile
        .connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0)
        .registerAddress(OTHER_1.address, profileId, rand, signature);

      let addresses = await ethosProfile.addressesForProfile(2);
      expect(addresses.length).to.be.equal(3, 'should be 3 addresses');

      // delete address at index 2
      await ethosProfile.connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0).deleteAddressAtIndex(2);

      addresses = await ethosProfile.addressesForProfile(2);
      expect(addresses.length).to.be.equal(2, 'should be 2 addresses');
      expect(addresses[0]).to.be.equal(PROFILE_CREATOR_0.address, 'wrong address[0]');
      expect(addresses[1]).to.be.equal(OTHER_0.address, 'wrong address[1]');

      //restore address(2)
      rand = '666';
      signature = await common.signatureForRegisterAddress(
        OTHER_1.address,
        profileId,
        rand,
        EXPECTED_SIGNER,
      );

      //restore address(2) but reverts with custom error MaxAddressesReached()
      await expect(ethosProfile
        .connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0)
        .registerAddress(OTHER_1.address, profileId, rand, signature)).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(ethosProfile, "MaxAddressesReached")
        .withArgs("2");;
    });
```
### Mitigation

To resolve the issue, ensure that restored addresses are removed from the **`removedAddresses`** array.
